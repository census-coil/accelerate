# Rock the Vote
We've partnered with <a href="https://www.rockthevote.org/" target="_blank">Rock the Vote</a> to raise awareness of the 2020 Census for young people through pop culture, music, art and technology.

We supported Rock the Vote in creating an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMaaH6Suf98" target="_blank">explainer video</a> _(right)_ on why the census matters; census curriculum as part of their <a href="https://www.rockthevote.org/resources/democracy-class/" target="_blank">Democracy Class</a>; and an <a href="https://www.creativesforthecount.org/" target="_blank">open source repository</a> for partner-driven and user-generated content that any census advocate can use for digital organizing.

# AnnLab x Wise Entertainment
The <a href="https://www.annenberglab.com/" target="_blank">USC Annenberg Innovation Lab</a> and <a href="http://www.wiseentertainment.com/" target="_blank">Wise Entertainment</a>, who make up the <a href="https://www.countthenation.org/" target="_blank">Count the Nation</a> initiative, have assembled a powerful coalition of experts in media, communications, data, technology and journalism to directly address perceived risks of census participation among communities fearful and distrusting of being counted.

We’ve collaborated with <a href="https://www.countthenation.org/" target="_blank">Count the Nation</a> to tap into the brilliant minds and networks of entertainment, executives, creatives and media powerhouses to spread the census message throughout pop culture.
