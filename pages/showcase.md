# Rock the Vote
Together, we’ve created an explainer video (right) on why the census matters; census curriculum as part of their Democracy Class; and an open source repository for partner-driven and user-generated content that any Census advocate can use for digital organizing (coming soon).

# USC Annenberg Innovation Lab x Wise Entertainment
AnnLab and Wise Entertainment have assembled a powerful coalition of experts in media, communications, data, technology and journalism to directly address perceived risks of census participation among communities fearful and distrusting of being counted.

We’ve collaborated with Count the Nation to tap into the brilliant minds and networks of entertainment, executives, creatives and media powerhouses to spread the census message throughout pop culture.
