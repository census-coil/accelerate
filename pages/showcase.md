# Rock the Vote
We've partnered with [Rock the Vote](https://www.rockthevote.org/) to raise awareness of the 2020 Census for young people through pop culture, music, art and technology.

We supported Rock the Vote in creating an [explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMaaH6Suf98) (right) on why the census matters; census curriculum as part of their [Democracy Class](https://www.rockthevote.org/resources/democracy-class/); and an open source repository for partner-driven and user-generated content that any census advocate can use for digital organizing (coming soon).

# AnnLab x Wise Entertainment
[The USC Annenberg Innovation Lab](https://www.annenberglab.com/) and [Wise Entertainment](http://www.wiseentertainment.com/), who make up the [Count the Nation](https://www.countthenation.org/) initiative, have assembled a powerful coalition of experts in media, communications, data, technology and journalism to directly address perceived risks of census participation among communities fearful and distrusting of being counted.

We’ve collaborated with [Count the Nation](https://www.countthenation.org/) to tap into the brilliant minds and networks of entertainment, executives, creatives and media powerhouses to spread the census message throughout pop culture.
