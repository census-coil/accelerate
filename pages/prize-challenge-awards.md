# Communities for the Count

After receiving over 750 video submissions in over a dozen languages from all across the United States, our panel of judges are narrowing it down to three videos with prize awards totaling $50,000.

Join us as we preview clips from some of the most inspiring and creative content, hear from special guests, and celebrate the winning videos. The virtual event will be hosted by Lorena Molina-Irizarry Director of Operations, Census Open Innovation Labs and Haley Ashcom Miller, Intergovernmental Affairs Specialist and Strategic Liaison, Census Open Innovation Labs.

### It's About Power and Money

The count of our population sets our country's trajectory for the next decade, determining congressional apportionment (the number of seats each state gets in the House of Representatives), redistricting, and how over $675 billion dollars are annually distributed to states, cities and counties across the nation for healthcare, education, transportation, emergency services, public services more. It's safe, it's important and it's the basis for democracy in the United States.

### Making a Difference

Hard-to-count communities such as racial and ethnic minorities, young and mobile populations, LGBTQI+, families with young children, people experiencing homelessness, renters, single-parent households and people with limited English proficiency are overwhelmingly undercounted in the Census. This video challenge helped individuals change that by telling their stories and communicating impact of the 2020 Census in their communities.
