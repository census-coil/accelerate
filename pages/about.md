# Our Story
</div>
</section>

<section class="usa-section usa-content">
<div class="usa-width-three-fourths" markdown="1">
#### Everyone deserves to be counted
Historically, certain groups have been undercounted at disproportionately high rates, including millennials, rural communities, families with young children, immigrants, non-native English speakers, renters, undererepresented minorities, and people experiencing homelessness — these are called “hard-to-count” communities. If these groups aren’t counted, their communities may not receive their fair share of countless services, resources, and representation. It also impacts the data upon which countless policy, legal, and business decisions are made.

#### We’re finding creative ways to help
We match creatives with community-based Census outreach efforts to generate innovative content that speaks to hard-to-count communities about why their participation matters.
<br><br>
Led by the U.S. Census Bureau, Accelerate works through content development sprints, partnerships, and events to bring together creatives, technologists, civic leaders and community organizers to ensure everyone in our country, regardless of location, income, race or ethnicity, is represented in the 2020 Census.

# The 2020 Census
</div>
</section>

<section class="usa-section usa-content">
<div class="usa-width-three-fourths" markdown="1">
The Decennial Census is a Constitutionally-mandated count of every person living in the United States, once each decade. This population count is used to determine the number of seats each state gets in the U.S. House of Representatives and how to distribute over $675 billion of annual federal funds to states, cities, and local communities for critical infrastructure and services such as housing, highways, schools, hospitals, and more.
#### New Opportunities New Challenges
Our next Decennial Census begins on April 1, 2020. This Census will count an increasingly diverse and growing population of about 330 million people in more than 140 million housing units, presenting new challenges.
<br><br>
This Census is the first ever “digital” census, which means there’s now an option to fill out each household census online. This is empowering in some ways but there are some real and perceived risks around participation and data security.
<br><br>
The media landscape has changed radically in the last 10 years. With the rise of social news and media fragmentation, there’s a need for more accurate, engaging content on media channels that people use the most in 2020.

* <strong>The Opportunity Project</strong><br>The Opportunity Project (TOP) is a technology accelerator program that brings together the tech industry, government, and communities, to generate digital products that benefit the public and drive the economy by using federal open data. TOP works through 12-week tech development sprints, facilitated by COIL, to drive new digital solutions that leverage federal, state and local open data to directly serve families, local leaders, and businesses and communities at large. To date, 80 products have been created through TOP, addressing problems like the opioid crisis, disaster response, veterans' employment, and more.
* <strong>Census Accelerate</strong><br>Census Accelerate is an initiative that matches creative talent with organizations serving hard-to-count communities in order to increase 2020 Census response rates. Like The Opportunity Project, Census Accelerate works in user-centered sprints and workshops in which participating companies, organizations, creative professionals, and influencers develop outreach materials for specific hard-to-count populations, such as families with children under the age of 5, mobile millennials, and LGBTQ populations.
