# Join Creatives For The Count
Create-a-thons bring people together to develop tangible digital content that organizations can use to amplify their existing census outreach efforts.
<br><br>
At these engaging workshops, creative students and professionals collaborate with nonprofit and civic organizations to reach hard-to-count communities in their area. In an action-packed session that can run from 2 hours to a full day, participants learn about the importance of getting out the count, connect with other organizations working to reach hard-to-count communities, and generate a bank of content to support 2020 Census outreach efforts.

            <h4>Grassroots organizations step up</h4>
            <p>Organizations supporting hard-to-count communities share their needs for census content and partner up with Accelerate and our robust event toolkit to create a one-day event to fulfill their needs.</p>
          </div>
      </li>
      <li><div class="step-circle">2</div>
        <div class="text">
          <h4>Creatives across the region step in</h4>
          <p>Talented designers, content strategists, storytellers, filmmakers and other creatives attend the event to learn more and collaborate on content that truly speaks to underrepresented communities.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><div class="step-circle">3</div>
        <div class="text">
          <h4>Content meets communities where they are</h4>
          <p>Content made with and for hard-to-count communities is shared back into the neighborhoods that are hardest to reach, and shared with the rest of the country through our partners.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><div class="step-circle">4</div>
        <div class="text">
          <h4>Repeat</h4>
          <p>The more community leaders and creatives collaborate to create and share, the more opportunities to reach new communities are made. Event participants may choose to create a new create-a-thon of their own or continue working in tandem through the remainder of 2020.</p>
