            <h4>Grassroots organizations step up.</h4>
            <p>Organizations supporting hard-to-count communities share their needs for census content and partner up with Accelerate and our robust event toolkit to create a one-day event to fulfill their needs.</p>

          <h4>Creatives across the region step in.</h4>
          <p>Talented designers, content strategists, storytellers, filmmakers and other creatives attend the event to learn more and collaborate on content that truly speaks to underrepresented communities.</p>

          <h4>Content meets communities where they’re at.</h4>
          <p>Content made with and for hard-to-count communities is shared. back into the neighborhoods that are hardest to reach, and shared with the rest of the country through our partners.</p>

          <p>The more community leaders and creatives collaborate to create and share, the more opportunities to reach new communities are made. Event participants may choose to create a new create-a-thon of their own or continue working in tandem through the remainder of 2020.</p>
