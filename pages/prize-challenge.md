# What is Census Accelerate?

Census Accelerate, a program of the [Census Open Innovation Labs](https://opportunity.census.gov/coil), brings together designers, content creators, filmmakers, and community representatives to generate compelling digital content focusing on helping communities most at risk of being undercounted in the [2020 Census](http://2020census.gov/).

## Why is it important?
The results of the 2020 Census will determine how congressional representation and billions of dollars in federal funding are distributed to states and cities for schools, roads, hospitals and more.

Some [hard-to-count](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/director/2018/11/counting_everyoneon.html) communities such as racial and ethnic minorities, young and mobile populations, and families with young children could miss out on their fair share, but we can help change that.

# What is the 'Get Out The Count' Video Challenge?
This is a nationwide call for the most impactful, accurate, inspiring, funny, creative, and culturally relevant videos to educate the masses about the 2020 Census and mobilize communities to respond, reminding them that [it’s not too late to self-respond](http://2020census.gov/) online, by phone or by mail.

</div>
<div class="usa-width-three-fourths top-space bottom-space" markdown="1" id="submit-your-video">
## The format
The challenge will focus on short-format video content—30 seconds to 3 minutes in length— for social platforms like YouTube, with the goal of informing the public about the importance of the census, and activating them to self-respond.

The U.S. Census Bureau will be awarding a total of $50,000 for video submissions that can encourage hard to count communities to fill out the Census.
