    This SBIR Phase I project intends to design and develop an innovative medical device solution that can potentially save $1.16B to the overall US healthcare system by reducing the procedural time and decreasing the number of catheters and devices used in Peripheral Vascular lnterven6on procedures. Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease affects more than 8 million people in the United States alone. The annual healthcare expenditure spent on treating peripheral arterial disease is $4.37B. Since 2008, US Center for Medicare and Medicaid has been stressing for greater efficiency and lowering costs for Peripheral Vascular Intervention. Commonly performed Peripheral Vascular Intervention procedures in the CathLab, to treat PAD, encounter loss of guidewire access. This complication is amplified in the case of difficult to cross stenotic lesions and, in many cases, is frustrating for the physician as they have to spend several hours/procedures trying to regain guidewire access. Guidewire access is the key for a successful procedural outcome. The Project intends to reduce Peripheral Vascular Intervention cost by improving procedural efficiency by eliminating guidewire/catheter exchanges in current practice thereby reducing Cath Lab overhead costs and by reducing procedure time and effort required to acquire a good quality angiographic image. An important ancillary benefit of the innovation is that the radiation exposure to the healthcare providers and the patient can potentially be minimized due to the decreased fluoroscopic activity. The project aims to continue beyond SBIR Phase I to become a commercial product and be the standard of care for Peripheral Vascular Intervention procedures.

    This SBIR Phase I project is for the design and development of a .014-inch guidewire compatible low profile PTA balloon catheter with a proprietary contrast injection mechanism. This product is ideal for performing PTA interventions in difficult anatomical spaces e.g. below-the-knee peripheral vasculature. The proprietary inflation and injection system allows for treatment visualization without needing catheter exchanges or loss of guidewire access. The output of the Project intends to provide focused and sharper visualization along the entire treatment length and allows for judicious usage of radiopaque contrast in contrast sensitive patients. A feasibility prototype of the concept was tested in an animal model with promising results. The SBIR Phase I project is focused on overcoming technical challenges to design and develop the unique device design to maintain a statistically significant rated burst pressure, develop and evaluate device bond joints per ISO standard 10555-1 2013, Sterile Single Use Intravascular catheters, develop the manufacturing process and tools, to integrate the catheter multi functionality. The Project intends to design and fabricate a test fixture to simulate clinical usage of the Innovative device per FDA Class II Guidance Controls for Percutaneous Transluminal Balloon Catheters and confirm that the catheter satisfies customer requirements. The Development efforts as part of SBIR Phase I project involve utilization of iterative design process. 3-dimensional design modeling and optimization, creation of a test fixture to simulate clinical usage, iterative prototyping and testing efforts to ensure the desired device specifications are met.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide access to a solar heat source for controlled high temperature applications using minimal, low-cost equipment. The proposed Solar Concentrator Unit (SCU) is the first step to providing individuals and underserved communities with the freedom of a low-cost alternative to many of their most pressing manufacturing and materials processing needs. The SCU produces no emissions in its heat generation, requires no fuel costs, and can be used in remote locations to deliver precision control to high temperature thermal processes. Many new applications become available to market participants through the proposed innovation with the most notable commercial outcome being a multi-material additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) system capable of producing custom metal and glass parts. Additional applications for the SCU include welding; recycling of waste material into useful feedstocks; pyrolysis of waste streams to render them chemically and biologically inert; sanitizing medical equipment in disaster response operations; and very high temperature materials science research by individuals and research institutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the design and performance of a SCU for delivering high temperatures in the range of 65 ?C to 2,200 ?C over long durations (6+ hours). The technology relies on concentrated solar energy as the primary heat source with the proposed innovation being a feedback control system for maintaining temperature of a receiver plane to within +/-5% of an operating value. The proposed innovation addresses the limitations of existing methods for concentrating solar energy which lack temperature control and whose consistency of output thermal flux varies with time of day, sun position, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions. This Phase I project will consist of development of a SCU prototype to conduct characterization tests on output solar flux and flux density under varying solar conditions. The expected outcome of this project will be to prove feasibility of the proposed design concept and evaluate its use for controlled, high temperature applications. The performance characteristics of the SCU will be fully explored in Phase I and the design of the SCU will allow for development of modular Thermal Processing Units in Phase II to interface with the concentrated solar spot produced by the SCU.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of MedSwarm, a software product for radiology that will significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce medical costs. MedSwarm is an AI-based collaborative decision-making system that will significantly amplify diagnostic accuracy across a wide range diagnoses, not by replacing radiologists with AI, but by amplifying their human expertise. MedSwarm employs a technology called Artificial Swarm Intelligence that collects input from small groups of doctors and uses AI to optimize their combined accuracy. This hybrid human-AI system will achieve diagnostic accuracies that significantly outperform (a) individual radiologists using standard techniques, and (b) current state-of-the-art in software-only AI. As a product, the MedSwarm system will be deployed as downloadable software compatible with all existing radiological workstations. Distribution to diagnostic teams will be as easy as opening a web-browser and connecting to a cloud-based server. The market opportunity is best modeled on the Computer Aided Detection (CAD) market, which is projected at $1.9 Billion by 2022. MedSwarm will not compete with current CAD products, as it will provide additional accuracy on all radiology workstations, whether or not other CAD tools are in use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop, test, and validate MedSwarm, the first commercially viable system for amplifying diagnostic accuracy of radiologists by combining human and machine intelligence. The technology, called Swarm AI, does not replace radiologists with AI, but connects small groups of radiologists together and optimizes their combined insights, enabling accuracy levels that greatly exceed baseline abilities. The company anticipates diagnostic error reductions of at least 30% using the system developed in Phase I, with the majority of the improvement being in the reduction of false-positives. The proposed research requires the development of new software modules, new optimization algorithms, and new interface protocols for enabling radiologists to connect online, view the same images at the same time, and work together as a real-time system to converge on unified diagnoses. Development also requires machine learning optimization across multiple experimental parameters, to reduce the time required for each diagnosis, increasing throughput and reducing costs. The company's goals for Phase I include a proof-of-concept system that (i) significantly outperforms individual radiologists, (ii) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning systems, and (iii) can identify which cases are most appropriate for this system, as compared to alternate methods.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be safer and more secure IoT platforms that will contribute to the growth of the IoT market. Current security technologies in the IoT arena are either weak or expensive (usually both). The weakness in conventional approaches lies in their impractical goal of finding and fixing all security vulnerabilities. Modern systems have complexity that vastly outstrips the capabilities of any human or verification tool to find all the security vulnerabilities. The only way to somewhat mitigate this weakness is to throw significant resources at the problem, which is very expensive and still yields an imperfect result. The proposed technology developed in this SBIR Phase I project will provide practical and strong security. It gains these important properties by assuming that all systems are riddled with vulnerabilities, so it builds in security by making IoT computing devices that are unsolvable puzzles to attackers. In addition, it doesn't rely on IoT developers to deploy hand-crafted defenses; instead, developers simply build their applications on the proposed platform, and they receive all of its security benefits.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new direction in IoT security. Unlike the world of IoT security today, where developers and tools are attempting to find and fix every last security vulnerability (and always failing), the technology being developed is a hardware-based secure IoT technology that is impractically difficult to penetrate. It achieves this by engaging ensembles of moving target defenses (EMTDs) on the runtime information that attackers need to build their attacks. To overcome EMTDs, attackers must extensively probe the system to acquire the run-time information obscured by moving target defenses. To stop these probes, the technology utilizes a technology called churn to re-key moving target defenses while the system is in operation. Once the churn mechanism is engaged, attackers will have to start their attack over again from scratch. With churn cycles of 50ms (or less), the proposed secure IoT platform becomes impractically difficult to breach, across a broad array of attack classes. The work proposed in this SBIR Phase I project will advance the technology from simulation to a real hardware implementation, which will allow the technology to be deployed into the IoT marketplace.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to promote empowerment of millions of blind and visually-impaired (BVI) people by enabling greater independence, supporting increased educational attainment, proliferation of vocational opportunities, and enhancing their overall quality of life. There are currently no commercial solutions for providing BVI users with an assistive technology (AT) solution that allows BVI users to seamlessly access textual and graphical information via a unified system. Towards meeting this greater goal, this Phase I SBIR project addresses key challenges relating to technical feasibility in creating the core algorithms of Midlina and the functional viability proving that BVI users will find practical utility in its application. By providing a much-needed AT solution leveraging touchscreen devices such as smart phones as a platform (which is already owned and used by more than 80% of BVI users), this project has a high probability of user adoption and market acceptance when commercialized. Given that vision loss is expected to double in the next 20 years owing to age-related eye diseases experienced by the rapidly aging population, this project will have significant economic benefits for the State/Federal agencies providing support services to BVI and aging population.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will show that a novel touchscreen-based information access software, called Midlina, will allow blind and visually-impaired (BVI) individuals to independently access textual and graphical information from digital media. The key innovation and strength of the proposed solution is in its ability to achieve this convergence of seamless text and graphical information access by integrating with native mobile operating systems (OS) used on smart touchscreen-based devices, the fastest growing computational platforms among BVI users. This project builds on strong theoretical underpinnings derived from 5-years of NSF-sponsored academic research involving hundreds of human testers and represents an excellent translational path towards commercialization. Two objectives will drive this Phase I project: (1) Developing a novel visual-to-multimodal conversion algorithm that is seamlessly integrated with a native mobile operating system, and (2) Establishing technical feasibility and practical usability of a prototype system through rigorous human user testing. A successful outcome of this Phase I project would lead to: (1) development of core algorithms for a novel touchscreen-based information access software, called Midlina, and (2) demonstrate feasibility that Midlina will enable BVI people to independently access both textual and graphical contents from digital media.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will primarily benefit people with hand amputations. Touch feedback is a critical component of human manipulation, and its loss is most poignant in people with hand amputations. There are currently no prosthetic devices available to amputees that provide control through touch sensory feedback. Without touch feedback, prosthetic users tend to avoid manipulating many objects they otherwise could because they run the risk of destroying them. Consequently, there is a market need for a richly expressive sensory feedback system for upper limb prosthetics. The proposed research will yield a device capable of such feedback with electrotactile stimulation. These outcomes have the potential to restore a significant amount of function to over 10 million people with hand amputations worldwide and improve their quality of life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves development of a portable, energy-efficient electrotactile stimulator that can be easily placed into the sockets of hand prosthetics to give users useful sensory feedback. The stimulator will integrate with existing prosthetic control systems. It will be built using standard off-the-shelf components, have a form factor small enough to easily fit into a variety of different prosthetic sockets, and operate for at least 12 hours while operating alongside a prosthetic hand and its control system. To improve sensation quality, a sensation controller that enables consistent long-term stimulation will be deployed, reducing the likelihood of device rejection due to discomfort. The expected outcomes of this research are 1) a portable, cost effective and energy efficient electrotactile stimulator that can be easily placed into the socket of a prosthetic user and integrated with their prosthetic hand; and 2) a user study which evaluates the effectiveness of this device deployed with a sensation controller for daily manipulation tasks. The capabilities of the Phase I prototype will be extended in Phase II for delivery of a market-ready sensory feedback system that is compliant with regulatory standards for medical equipment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project comprises the development of a wearable system capable of accurately tracking glaucoma progression via continuous monitoring of intraocular pressure (IOP). Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and affects nearly 80 million people worldwide. Using a novel wearable system, optometrists, ophthalmologists, and medical professionals across multiple disciplines can review the IOP trends at visits, monitor high-risk patients in real-time, and program patient-specific threshold alarms that will prevent irreversible blindness caused by glaucoma and related conditions. Through successful product commercialization, the novel wearable blindness prevention system (BPS) is expected to be adopted by approximately 2 million glaucoma patients annually. Users of the device will have continuous access to IOP data trends. Clinicians will be alerted when at-risk patients fail to comply with prescribed daily medicinal treatment (due to excessive IOP levels) and can continuously track the efficacy of prescribed IOP-lowering treatments. Finally, the IOP tracking capability of the system will allow improvements in the quality of care for general clinicians, medical specialists, and clinical researchers and will be a major player in the current move toward data-driven, value care.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on laboratory feasibility testing of the fundamental concept behind the novel blindness prevention system technology - image-based pressure sensing - on a benchtop 3D-printed glaucoma simulator that is monitored using an alpha prototype of the system.  The research plan includes testing of the feasibility of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera which fits inside a pair of eyeglass frames, plus processor, optics, and software, as a way to record pressure changes in eye tissue in a benchtop environment. The key objective is to accurately - and with high repeatability - detect unhealthy eye pressure levels in the simulator using an alpha prototype, a-BPS, that communicates with a standard mobile device.  The target research outcome for the a-BPS is to successfully trigger a high-pressure alarm in a repeatable manner whenever eye pressure in the simulator exceeds a clinically-relevant threshold. It is anticipated that the Phase I research results will show successfully operation in 90% or more of the test samples. The output from the Phase I effort will be used as design inputs for a Phase II prototype, which will be wearable and will allow testing on humans.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a practical method for ultra-secure global communication using quantum key distribution (QKD). QKD is an established communications protocol which promises unbreakable encryption via the exchange of single photons, the constituent particles of light. Owing in large part to the lack of a practical way to connect users globally, QKD has not yet been widely deployed. This project aims to demonstrate the viability of high-speed, satellite-to-ground QKD using the low-cost CubeSat platform. If successful, this design will dramatically reduce the initial costs to launch a QKD constellation offering worldwide QKD connectivity, thereby greatly expanding the utility of QKD and driving market growth. Early customers will be the US Government and large businesses who are willing to pay a premium for the ultimate in data security. Government use offers clear societal benefit, as several agencies rely on secure global communications to ensure societal well-being. As technology advances, the network may be used to secure the communications of private citizens. The proposed plan will furthermore develop enabling technologies for future space-based quantum science experiments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce designs for a high-speed QKD payload hosted on a CubeSat. The proposed design will take a substantial step forward from the first and only demonstration of satellite-to-ground QKD (Micius, 2017), which relied on technology that is too massive, expensive, and low-throughput for commercial use. Since CubeSats are heavily constrained in size, weight, and power, the major technical challenge will be to miniaturize the payload and reduce its power consumption while simultaneously improving data rates. To address this challenge, the small business will investigate a novel QKD payload concept that pushes the limits of emerging technologies in photonics and microelectromechanical systems. In Phase I, detailed modeling and simulation of candidate payload designs will be used to evaluate the commercial and technical feasibility of the proposed approach, and to select a preliminary design for initial implementation, which will commence in Phase II.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will support the research and development
    of a new medical device designed to prevent deep vein thrombosis in hospitalized
    patients. Deep vein thrombosis occurs when blood clots form in the veins and is
    a common complication in hospital patients that is also a leading cause of preventable
    death in the United States. This project will develop a device that modifies blood
    flow patterns in the legs in a new manner designed to specifically activate genetic
    changes inside the vein that protect against blood clot formation. The goal of
    this project is to generate a new device that it is capable of creating the desired
    blood flow patterns in patients while maintaining a high level of device comfort,
    reliability, and ease of use for clinical staff and patients. In addition to preventing
    death and disability in the hospitalized population of the US, this project will
    move a new device towards commercial production, thereby supporting economic growth,
    job formation, and tax revenue. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project will leverage novel
    molecular and cellular discoveries regarding the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis
    (DVT) to create a more effective device to prevent DVT in immobilized individuals
    who are at high risk for the disease. DVTs form in the sinus behind venous valves,
    where blood flow is reduced during immobility, promoting blood clot formation.
    This site is typically protected against clot formation by a powerful genetic
    program in the endothelial cells that is unique to the valve sinus microenvironment.
    Loss of this genetic expression program results in a prothrombotic environment
    that supports clot formation and DVT. Research has further revealed that the valve
    sinus anti-thrombotic genetic program is activated by a specific pattern of venous
    blood flow at that site that is driven by muscular activity. During prolonged
    periods of immobility, common during hospitalization, loss of this flow profile
    extinguishes the protective endothelial phenotype and supports DVT formation.
    Ultrasound analysis reveals that current mechanical therapy devices marketed to
    prevent DVT do not generate the hemodynamics at the valve that are produced by
    muscular activity due to their methods of action. This project will develop a
    device that generates a protective hemodynamic pattern in the valve sinus of immobile
    patients by actuating blood flow that accurately reproduce muscular activity.
    To accomplish this goal the device design alters the primary physical manipulation
    strategy of other existing devices away from calf and thigh compression and instead
    induces rapid calf expansion to replicate the effect of muscular activity on venous
    blood flow. Vascular ultrasound studies demonstrate that this actuation method
    successfully recapitulates the venous hemodynamics of the active limb required
    to support expression of the protective genetic pathway in the valve sinus. This
    SBIR Phase I project will optimize the device design to create this actuation
    while also improving patient comfort, mitigating common risks, and facilitating
    ease of use by clinical staff. This project will address key risks in advancing
    a medical device into clinical testing and use, thereby enabling the device to
    bridge to a phase of commercial manufacturing and use.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a better and safer alternative to conventional piezoelectric ultrasonic instruments that use liquid-coupled transducers for the inspection of pipelines, tanks, and other structures used in power generation and liquid process industries. This new instrument does not require the use of liquid coupling, and can work on rough, coated, or contaminated surfaces that cannot be inspected with conventional liquid-coupled techniques unless the part is subjected to costly and time consuming part preparation. By not using liquids, this instrument can also be used on components that are very hot, very cold, radioactive, or in a vacuum. A high-resolution ultrasonic instrument that does not use couplant and has comparable performance to a piezoelectric instrument will save inspection time, reduce inspection costs, and permit inspections while in-service, which will result in millions of dollars in savings for plant operators. Society as a whole will also benefit from improvements in safety and performance of the plants, and by reducing the amount of waste and contaminants released into the environment as direct sub-product of the inspection, or from failures in facilities and equipment.

    The proposed project consists of the development of a portable, high-resolution, ultrasonic phased array instrumentation, software, and transducers based on non-contact Electro Magnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) technology to substitute or complement the tens of thousands of conventional piezoelectric instruments in the market. For the instrumentation, the research will revolve around the development of a high-power and compact 16-channel pulser/receiver with a very small dead zone that permit inspection near the surface of the part. This instrumentation will also require custom software with signal-enhancing algorithms that compensate for the small amplitude of EMAT signals. The 16-channel phased-array EMAT transducers will involve multi-physics simulation of electrical and magnetic components to develop very small and high-density coil elements that can produce enough signal amplitude at high-frequencies while handling the pulsing rates required for effective inspection, and the high-power generated by the custom instrumentation. All these components will need to be enclosed in a battery-powered package that can be used in the harsh conditions typically found in field inspections. The expected result is a portable instrument that can compete in performance with conventional piezoelectric instruments, especially in applications and inspection environments where a conventional instrument is not practical or very costly to use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project is to save lives through the proliferation of miniaturized automated external
    defibrillators that attach to smartphones. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) will kill more than 325,000
    Americans this year outside of the hospital. An SCA can cause death if it is not treated in
    minutes. If an AED is available, it can save a person's life; some estimates suggest a 27% increase
    in the number of people who could be saved if AEDs are available and used when needed. A
    miniaturized AED embedded in a smartphone case could save lives by making AEDs more
    available and ensuring those who carry them are reachable by emergency medical services. The
    strategy is to equip law enforcement, firefighters, EMS personnel, and potential citizen first responders
    with this device and use smartphone technology to ensure they are reachable when
    in proximity to someone experiencing an SCA. It provides an opportunity for a new paradigm in
    first response: AED carriers that can be located during the first critical moments of an SCA.
    Through this research, hundreds of thousands of lives can be saved each year.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will prove out the concept of a
    regulatory-compliant miniaturized AED that integrates with a smartphone. The work includes
    researching and designing components and electronics that will enable creation of this critical
    medical device and accomplish three overarching goals: (1) design and develop the miniaturized
    components, interconnects, firmware and software necessary to implement the hand-held AED
    Smartphone case in Phase Two by evaluating high voltage power supply and switching
    electronics and completing a power converter and switching design capable of generating the
    required energy from an on-board lithium-ion battery and supporting a bi-phasic waveform; (2)
    develop the smartphone software and firmware necessary to implement the device itself, guide
    a user through the emergency protocol, and send GPS information to EMS to allow them to
    locate proximal first responders; (3) integrate the hardware and software into a prototype that
    demonstrates a path to a form factor function unit in Phase 2. Research and designs of
    interconnects and encapsulation methods developed as part of this effort will offer insight into
    the miniaturization of myriad electronics both within and outside the medical domains.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relates to the historic challenges associated with composite manufacturing, including long cycle times, poor recyclability, labor-intensive manufacturing, and energy-intensive curing processes. Thermoplastic composites have the potential to reduce cycle time, reduce labor requirements, and improve recyclability; however, traditional thermoplastic processes are energy intensive. This Phase 1 SBIR is seeking new, more efficient process heating methods that can be integrated into a continuous composite manufacturing process to improve production speed and reduce operating costs, enabling the growth of composite materials in weight sensitive industries that require high-volume, low-cost structural components, including automotive, unmanned aircraft, wind turbines, and cargo transportation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the technical feasibility of ultrasonic heating and induction heating as an alternative to infrared heating in a continuous composite forming process. Process heating constitutes a significant portion of the direct energy consumed by in manufacturing. This is particularly true in the production of fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites, where the polymer matrix must be melted as part of the consolidation process. As part of this Phase 1 project, heater modules for induction heating, ultrasonic heating, and infrared heating will be developed and integrated into a bench-scale, continuous composite forming prototype. Composite material will be produced using each heating method and energy consumption will be monitored during the forming process. The composite material produced during testing will be weighed and embodied energy will be calculated by dividing the total energy consumed by the mass of the material. The objective of this work is to identify a heating method that can reduce embodied energy by at least 40%, relative to the infrared heating system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project stems from the need to substantially improve nitrogen (N) use efficiency in crop production and thereby improve profitability for farmers, while simultaneously reducing the adverse effects of agriculture on the environment.  Currently, less than half of the N fertilizer applied to agricultural fields is used by the crops to which it is applied.  The remaining N is either leached from the soil or lost to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide - potent greenhouse gas. This inefficient use of N fertilizer by crops is an economic burden for farmers, cause serious water and air quality problems, and contribute about 2.5% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, these N losses represent a tremendous energy inefficiency, because the production of synthetic N fertilizer is the largest energy input in production agriculture. The key to improving N use efficiency in crop production is applying the right amount of N fertilizer in the right place at the right time. The proposed sensor technology would be disruptive to existing agricultural technology and practices, wherein N fertilizer is applied at a uniform rate across agricultural fields, and improve profitability for farmers.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a robust field-mobile soil nitrate (NO3-) sensor utilizing mid-infrared technology to facilitate precision N fertilizer applications. Mid-infrared spectrometers have historically been large, expensive, and fragile laboratory instruments that require substantial sample preparation, thus preventing their use as mobile optical soil NO3- sensors. The scope of the Phase I research will focus on three objectives: 1) The design and development of a robust and low-cost mid-infrared spectrometer that uses a diamond attenuated total internal reflectance (D-ATR) probe to measure NO3- levels; 2) The design, construction, and testing of a chisel shank-tool bar system that houses the spectrometer and D-ATR probe; and 3) the development of control and data processing and analysis software to manage the system. Anticipated technical results of Phase I will provide a prototype that can measure NO3- in the upper 30 cm of soil, not just at the surface, by enabling modulation of the depth of the shank and the probe as the system is pulled through a field, and self-cleaning of the system as soil is continuously moved across the optical surface of the diamond by the forward motion of the tractor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a traveling-wave parametric amplifier (TWPA) prototype suitable to be marketed to the Quantum Information Processing community. Quantum computers require extremely sensitive amplifiers operating near absolute zero to amplify weak signals. There are two critical features of this amplifier that will benefit the community directly: 1) the ability to have more qubits per amplifier - essential for large scale quantum computers, and 2) the ability to use a commercial manufacturing process. As quantum hardware continues to scale, so does the number of qubits, making multichannel amplifiers essential. European and Asian investment in quantum technology is growing at an alarming rate. The US is at risk of losing the leading position in this technical space. The commercialization of TWPA technology is an example of technologies required for the US to remain competitive in quantum technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will introduce a TWPA product prototype for the Quantum Information Processing market by addressing some of the interfacing, packaging and manufacturing limitations of experimental devices. Critical to the ability to distribute these amplifiers to the market is a means of manufacturing such devices at scale. A key advantage of the proposed technology is its ease of fabrication and the fact that it can be fabricated using an industry standard process, which will be demonstrated during the Phase I project.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to dramatically improve Lithium-Ion Battery
    (LIB) technology in order to advance renewable energy penetration and reduce greenhouse
    gas emissions. LIBs are not only a major component of the current consumer electronics
    industry - they are also becoming a key linchpin in the development of clean energy
    applications such as electric vehicles and grid storage. Their limited cost-competitiveness
    relative to fossil fuels, finite energy density, and limited lifetime are all
    still road blocks against mainstream adoption of these emerging applications.
    These issues all point toward a need for significant technical advancements that
    cannot be satisfied by simple economies of scale alone. Coreshell?s innovation
    is to introduce a cheap and scalable electrode coating technology that protects
    batteries against cycling degradation. The technology has the potential to yield
    a marked improvement in battery cost and performance, as well as a reduction in
    manufacturing rates by replacing a slow electrochemical step that can take days
    with a fast coating step that can be completed within minutes. If fully actualized,
    Coreshell?s coatings have the potential to revolutionize the LIB industry and
    enable widespread commercialization of clean energy technologies. \nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of Coreshell?s unique electrode coating technology. The state-of-the-art electrode
    surface protection in LIBs is formed electrochemically and is termed ?SEI? (Solid-Electrolyte-Interphase).
    SEI is slow and expensive to make, inherently unstable, and consumes lithium thereby
    reducing capacity. This proposal is based on a novel proprietary coating in place
    of SEI, using a roll-to-roll process that can be seamlessly integrated into existing
    LIB manufacturing lines. By depositing well-formed coatings on the surface of
    battery electrodes, Coreshell?s technology can protect against many of the degrading
    reactions that occur during LIB cycling. The proposed technology has the promise
    to deliver greater initial capacity, greater depth-of-charge over equivalent cycle-life,
    reduced manufacturing costs and, ultimately, the potential to reduce LIB cost
    per kWh by up to 25%. In Phase I, Coreshell will demonstrate part of this value
    through two main objectives. The first is to increase initial battery capacity
    by >5% and retain the total capacity to >90% of original after 200 cycles. The
    second is to show that batteries incorporating Coreshell?s coated electrodes can
    eschew SEI formation, which would demonstrate the feasibility of ~7% reduction
    in manufacturing costs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
    been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be realized first in household cleaning applications, a market valued in more than 26 billion/year, where currently only about 3% of the market is filled with eco-friendly alternatives. Cleancult new scrubbing system will allow the development of more efficient and potent cleaning products, capable of competing with traditional petroleum-based brands while helping to reduce the water pollution effects due to laundry/cleaning activities, reduce the appearance of skin conditions in customers due to the continuous exposure to harmful chemicals found in traditional cleaning products, and reduce the energetic cost related to the use of hot water in laundry applications. Cleancult objective is to open the door to novel green clean technologies, by first introducing our all-natural scrubbing system in our products and potentially license the technology to other green detergents manufacturers, and later introduce our own all-natural green surfactant molecule, with the solid intention of increasing the green cleaners? participation in the marker by at least 20% in the next 5 years.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide funding for the development of a micellar system(s) composed of a biopolymer particle and a naturally derived from sustainable sources surfactant compound. The conjugation and stabilization mechanism of these micellar systems are the main focus on the research objectives, together with the inclusion of different functionalization to improve oil removal, avoid re-deposition and also enhance the antibacterial properties of the scrubbing system. The complete characterization of the micellar system and its efficacy in removing soil/dirt stains will be achieved through the use of spectroscopic, rheological and hydrodynamic techniques, surface chemistry modifications, and applying the global standards for detergency determination. The research team will work to provide a commercially ready product at the end of this SBIR Phase I project, and due to already in place collaborations with manufacture facilities will avoid delays in the introduction of Cleancults' new line of green powerful cleaners.

    This SBIR Phase I project intends to improve the outcomes of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by providing critical data from non-clinical settings that are currently unavailable to autism treatment providers. The project also focuses on accelerating the analysis of that data. It is estimated that the costs associated with ASD will be more than $2 million over a patient's life. However, studies have shown that the costs of lifetime care for a child diagnosed with ASD can be reduced by 2/3 with early intervention. Designing an appropriate treatment program, and then monitoring its efficacy, requires the collection of a range of data to avoid dependence on inference and anecdotes. Treatment providers often collect detailed data while working with an individual diagnosed with ASD, but they count on parents and caregivers to provide them with data regarding the child's progress outside the clinical setting. The data submitted are usually incomplete and inadequate (if submitted at all). This SBIR Phase I project will result in a prototype that will rapidly provide autism treatment providers with critical data and analysis, reducing the amount of time it takes to design an optimal treatment program, and thereby reducing the long-term costs associated with a diagnosis of ASD.


    This Phase I project will result in a prototype that will make the process of logging data almost frictionless for parents. That narrative data will be combined with video data, biometric data, and additional data collected passively from external sources. All the data will be merged, and then analyzed via machine learning to locate patterns and provide a complete picture to the child's behavior analyst. Developing a camera that will be unobtrusive enough for a child with ASD to tolerate will present a challenge, as will developing the associated software to tag items within the camera's view and save only relevant clips (such as the times immediately before, during and after a meltdown). It will also be challenging to develop a wearable device that a child with ASD will tolerate, along with the associated sensors and software to track metrics associated with arousal and stress. The most significant technical challenge, however, will be to develop the software that combines the multiple data streams and outputs a standardized ABC report (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence) that would be judged as high quality by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to introduce a fully integrated current sensor with an order of magnitude performance improvement over state-of-the-art technologies. The developed technology will enable more reliable, efficient and compact power electronics systems. Power electronics is an integral part of today's power delivery systems such as renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, data centers and most consumer electronics. In these applications, electric current information is often an essential parameter that needs to be known and measured for control, diagnostic and prognostic purposes. With advances in power electronic circuits with specific attention to high frequency power converters, there is a need to investigate alternative approaches and techniques to measure the current. These approaches should result in availability of current sensors that have fast-response, are accurate, loss-less, and preferably non-intrusive. The impact of such a sensor is to enable systems and circuits that will be miniaturized and be made more efficient by using wide bandgap semiconductors and high switching frequencies. Additionally, the availability of current measurement information will lead to greater reliability and prognostic capability. Applications include but are not limited to power converters in electric vehicles and data centers.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel contactless, hybrid current sensor offering an order of magnitude better performance than the state-of-the-art in capturing currents up to and beyond 30 MHz for use in emerging high-frequency power converter applications utilizing wide bandgap semiconductors. The proposed sensor combines complementary magnetoresisor and Rogowski coil technology along with magnetic concentrators into a single chip. By combining these previously underexplored technologies in discrete current sensing would result in a non-invasive, lossless current sensor for MHz converters, where today none exists. Phase I objectives will address technical challenges in developing a chip-scale integrated sensor, including miniaturized Rogowski coil design and magnetic concentrator shape and material evaluation for signal amplification and electromagnetic interference rejection. Design of the analog signal conditioning circuits required for the integrated circuits are also part of this phase.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project involves improving oil and gas sustainability.  To achieve that goal, we are proposing purifying produced water at the wellsite using waste natural gas to reduce disposal costs, carbon footprint and human induced seismicity from disposal wells. This process is enabled by patented equipment that fundamentally changes thermal distillation by performing the entire process inside a heat exchanger to reduce equipment and energy costs.   In Texas, using the amount of gas that is flared annually, the proposed X-VAPTM system can theoretically purify a significant percentage of U.S. produced water problem of 33 billion barrels in 2020.  The brine discharge from the purification process will be concentrated into specific densities to be recycled as a drilling fluid.  This new circular economy will provide environmental benefits by reducing the need for large diesel water trucks to move the source water, dispose the produced water and deliver heavy brine for drilling.  Society will benefit with a new renewable source of fresh water and reduce the need for oil and gas producers to compete with farmers and ranchers for increasingly scarce fresh water resources.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to prove the X-VAPTM thermal distillation system can fundamentally improve thermal distillation by reducing equipment costs and energy requirements.  Before this patented invention, the entire thermal distillation including the distillation and separation from contaminates has never been performed inside a heat exchanger. The unique design provides a removable spring water tray and distillation column to address maintenance issues including scaling in the field.  Our team of industry-experienced engineers will further test, improve and validate the existing thermal distillation prototype by performing prototype lab experiments and coordinated simulations to calibrate and improve equipment designs (Phase I).  These novel simulations will need to be calibrated against coordinated prototype laboratory tests to achieve a 90% agreement between simulations and laboratory tests.  This testing data and correlated simulations will be utilized to scale the prototype design to efficiently handle large volumes of produced water typically encountered at oil and gas well sites.  The proposed research and simulation testing will validate the patented system and create a proposed program for customer field testing prior to commercialization (Phase II).

    this SBIR project is to develop HLB and canker-resistant citrus varieties by using
    gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9. Florida citrus growers need a solution to these
    diseases, and producing a genetically-resistant citrus variety is a promising
    strategy. The approach is to modify plant genes that are the targets of proteins
    secreted by the disease-causing bacteria. The first objective is to conduct the
    gene editing in commercially viable citrus varieties. This will be accomplished
    non-transgenically by transforming a non-integrated plasmid or purified Cas9 protein
    and in vitro transcribed sgRNA in citrus protoplasts. To identify gene edits,
    protoplasts will be grown into callus, which will be screened by PCR and DNA heteroduplex
    digestion as well as Sanger and/or high-throughput sequencing. The second objective
    will be to take plants with confirmed edits, clonally propagate them, and conduct
    preliminary testing for HLB or canker resistance. Plants will be inoculated with
    the disease-causing bacteria and then monitored for disease progression by observation
    of physical characteristics and measurement of bacterial titers by PCR. The best
    performing mutations from Phase I will be combined and used for more extensive
    greenhouse and field testing during SBIR Phase II.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology that will enable robust, contamination-free,
    continuous biomanufacturing.  While biomanufacturing may be one of the most technologically
    complex and profitable industries, the underlying production process, batch fermentation,
    has not changed in decades. In theory, continuous fermentation would decrease
    operational cost and increase production capacity.  However, owing to the high
    risk of contamination, continuous fermentation is considered unreliable and is
    rarely used. The proposed technology solves this issue and enables contamination-free,
    continuous fermentation. Successful implementation of continuous fermentation
    facilitates automated production and paves the way for future technological development
    in continuous product purification and recovery. The reduced operational cost
    is essential for the economic viability of bio-based commodity chemicals such
    as bioplastics, as their market demand depends primarily on their price competitiveness
    with petroleum-derived counterparts. The proposed technology also eliminates the
    use of antibiotics in fermentation, which in turn alleviates antibiotic misuse
    and promotes a positive environmental and health impact. \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to explore the feasibility of using a biocide/biocide-resistant
    system to prevent and treat microbial contamination during continuous biomanufacturing.
    Microbial contamination in biomanufacturing processes is a major concern, as it
    results in loss of productivity, time, and money.  In addition, it restricts the
    production mode to slow batch fermentation, and prohibits the implementation of
    continuous fermentation. The proposed technology solves the contamination problem,
    as a biocide will inhibit the invading microbial and viral contaminants and a
    biocide-resistant enzyme will protect the processing hosts. The proposed Phase
    I research will address the technical challenges by using classical molecular
    biology and synthetic biology techniques. The first objective is to demonstrate
    that the proposed technology will provide biocide resistance to bioplastics-producing
    organisms while inhibiting the outgrowth of contaminants. The second objective
    is to show that the proposed technology can be used to prevent and treat contamination
    in continuous fermenters. The final objective is to fine-tune the biocide/biocide-resistant
    system to demonstrate the technology will not adversely affect the production
    yield and product quality in continuous fermenters. If successful, future Phase
    II development will be conducted in pilot and industrial-scale reactors to further
    optimize the technology.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address a critical bottleneck to widespread
    advanced material use in commercial markets.  Carbon nanotubes are advanced supermaterials
    that have been at the forefront of technological innovation since their discovery
    in the early 1990s, but limited commercial success has ensued due to their high
    cost of production.  Current use of carbon nanotube materials is limited to a
    few industries capable of absorbing the high cost of research-scale quantities
    of carbon nanotubes (defense applications, aerospace manufacturers, and research
    institutions). Achieving scalable, lower-cost carbon nanotube manufacturing processes
    will enable widespread applications such as: advanced batteries with lower cost,
    weight, and improved longevity, tires with longer lifetimes and increased fuel
    efficiency, and coatings enabling enhanced functionality such as in the case of
    de-icing for aircrafts, spacecraft vehicles, and drones.  The societal impact
    of this advancement includes better performing and more energy efficient devices
    for consumers without added cost.  The commercial impact of this technology will
    enable the significant effort carried out in many market sectors to evaluate and
    understand the benefit of carbon nanotubes to products, to be economically realized.
    \   \n\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
    develop a novel electrochemical liquid-phase growth method for carbon nanotube
    production, which significantly lowers the cost of production for carbon nanotubes
    and enables widespread commercial use of the materials.  The largest bottleneck
    to carbon nanotube utilization today is the high production cost that arises due
    to numerous factors including low efficiency of chemical processes, high overhead
    cost for scaling, and formation of toxic by-products that require additional costs.
    \ These limitations have led to high prices for the materials that prohibit their
    use in cost-sensitive markets, which rely on low-cost additives such as carbon
    black.  The research objectives of this SBIR project will demonstrate feasibility
    of using a scalable catalyst preparation and deposition technique for the production
    of carbon nanotubes through low-cost, environmentally-beneficial electrochemical
    routes.  To achieve this, we will utilize ambient processing for catalyst preparation
    and a scalable electrochemical reaction chamber that harnesses the precision of
    electrochemistry, sources the carbon feedstock directly from air, and operates
    at extremely high energy efficiencies (>90%).  The anticipated technical results
    include a rapid and scalable growth technique with minimized added cost from catalyst
    deposition without compromising carbon nanotube quality.\n\nThis award reflects

    needed to identify effective antibiotics for urinary tract infections (UTIs) from
    2 days to 2 hours. Every year in the US, 13 million UTIs are treated with a physician's
    best guess antibiotic, because antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is too
    slow. Up to half of first guesses are wrong, opening up the possibility for infections
    to worsen into life-threatening sepsis and allowing antimicrobial resistance to
    evolve. One quarter of 1.5 million sepsis cases and at least 250,000 deaths every
    year begin as UTIs. Rapid AST using biophysical sensing can take guesswork out
    of UTI treatment, save lives, and avoid billions in unnecessary healthcare costs.
    By sensing bacterial cell fluctuations associated with the mechanically active
    processes of metabolism, motility, and growth, this novel and fundamentally different
    measurement concept for AST enables almost an order of magnitude increase in speed.
    This project will establish technical and commercial feasibility of developing
    the underlying sensor technology for point-of-care diagnostics that demand push-button
    technology operable in a hectic clinical environment. Translating innovative federally-funded
    technologies like this out of the laboratory and into medical clinics will build
    taxpayers' return on basic research investments. \n\nThis project tackles a key
    technical hurdle for clinical implementation of rapid biophysical AST at a meaningful
    scale: demonstration that the demanding performance characteristics of the underlying
    resonating quartz sensor technology can be reproduced using low cost materials
    for a disposable resonator housing providing fluidic, thermal, and electrical
    control.  The rapid biophysical AST method takes the pulse of bacterial cells.
    Changes in mechanical fluctuations of cells occur after exposure to an effective
    antibiotic, and can be sensed in real time by detecting phase noise generated
    by cells on a resonating crystal substrate. Key to the commercial success of this
    technology are multichannel resonators that can be manufactured in large quantities
    to perform with very low noise resonance characteristics. Best practices from
    low cost microfluidics studies will dovetail with those from high-tech resonator
    development to deliver the phase noise performance needed to pick up the biological
    signal. Rapid prototyping tools including 3D printing will be used for quick design
    iterations. If satisfactory, Phase II will optimize fabrication methodologies
    for both resonators and housing modules interfacing with a fully integrated clinical
    prototype instrument ready to support clinical trials of the technology.\n\nThis

    \ The technology would enable: all-natural, shelf stable fruit and vegetable products

    of the total US national energy budget used for food-related energy, and high

    \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop, validate, and build-upon initial
    research to evaluate the feasibility and scope of a novel food processing technology.
    Traditional processing methodologies have fundamental drawbacks.  High temperature
    treatments degrade nutritional quality while altering texture and taste of end-products.
    Freezing negatively affects the reconstitution properties of fruits and vegetables,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a scalable, enterprise-ready conversational AI platform that enables businesses to automate customer support requests, optimize call routing efforts to get customers to the right human support agent, generate customer self-service resources like smart FAQs, augment human staff with bot capabilities, and enable personalized recommendations to support sales and purchasing decisions for customers. Such technology is beneficial to any enterprise organization, B2C (business-to-consumer) and B2B (business-to-business), who needs to communicate to customers, employees, and the public. With rising customer service and communication costs, automation is critical for businesses to maintain profitability and competitive advantages. On a societal level, conversational interfaces democratize access to information and resources worldwide. A significant portion of the world's population lives in regions where internet access is poor and device ownership is rare. Many also suffer from physical limitations, such as impaired vision or limited motor control. Accelerating technology access through conversational interfaces such as SMS and voice has already been shown to transform quality of life for disadvantaged groups through applications in telemedicine, personal finance, and education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable human-level conversational ability in machines. Teaching computers to communicate like humans is a critical step to achieving human-level machine intelligence (HLMI), also called artificial general intelligence (AGI). Current state-of-the-art approaches to automated dialog systems use a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning implemented with deep neural network architectures. These approaches have shown promise on toy problems in academic research, but have mixed performance in enterprise settings. This Phase 1 project extends current deep learning approaches by developing a repeatable methodology for annotating and preparing enterprise data for use in dialog systems and a scalable, grounded neural network architecture that can reference external knowledge sources with minimal manual engineering.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to improve law enforcement (LE) effectiveness in battling the illegal drug epidemic in the U.S. Death rates related to drug use have been increasing yearly and exceeded 72,000 Americans in 2017. To control this epidemic, the President?s 2019 Budget Request called for $30B in federal funding to combat illegal drug use, presenting a commercial opportunity to disrupt the existing market for conventional color test kits and Raman-based testing systems. Numerous interviews conducted with LE and forensic supply resellers demonstrate a readiness to adopt a new technology to replace drug test kits currently in use. This novel drug test system will improve the accuracy, reliability, ease of use, safety, and affordability of field drug identification and permit field use data analysis, which will help remove dangerous drugs from the streets. This innovation will also enhance the understanding of the chemical and photoluminescent properties of narcotic drugs reacting with various drug-indicator materials such as copper(I) iodide and validate the use of such information to identify suspected drugs. This is a wireless technology for the LE market sector, with the potential to eventually expand into the medical diagnostics and environmental analysis markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel system for on-site field drug testing for LE. Conventional chemical-based color tests are outdated and highly flawed, causing issues for end users and the rest of the drug enforcement ecosystem. These issues include false positive drug tests and the lack of ability to identify new drugs that are introduced into U.S. communities each year. Superior testing methods such as handheld Raman devices are too expensive for LE agencies to widely adopt, thus a low-cost technologically-innovative solution is necessary. This innovation leverages photoluminescence spectroscopy in four main components: a handheld spectrometer, a drug-sampling device, a mobile app with a matching algorithm and access to a cloud database of reference drug standards. The goal of this phase I project is to achieve a high-fidelity Minimum Viable Product drug testing system. The investigation of alternative fluorescent drug-indicators is anticipated to result in novel methods for drug identification with high selectivity and sensitivity. These methods will be implemented into a drug-sampling device. As a part of software and hardware optimization, beta testers within LE will help identify system shortcomings and provide input to develop enhancements for usability and ergonomics.

    This SBIR Phase I project supports development of an innovative device for use in laparoscopy (minimally invasive surgery of the abdomen). Laparoscopic injuries most often occur during primary port entry, before visualization into the abdominal cavity is possible. Injuries are primarily to the bowel or vasculature and are very serious, with mortality rates up to 5% for bowel injuries and up to 15% for vascular injuries. To minimize this risk, surgeons lift the abdominal wall away from the vital organs that could be inadvertently punctured during primary port entry. Two lifting techniques are commonly utilized, but one is unreliable and the other invasive. The product in development utilizes suction instead of mechanical force to grasp the abdominal wall and is more reliable and less invasive than the current techniques. Projected benefits include better surgical outcomes, increased surgeon and patient satisfaction, and decreased patient post-op pain. Successful development of this product is forecasted to create 40 new jobs by 2023 with an annual payroll exceeding $2.5M. As a direct result of this Phase I grant, this innovative product can reach the U.S. market in 2019 and become the gold standard for abdominal wall lifting devices in the next five years.

    The technical innovation in this proposed project is a novel abdominal lifting device for use in laparoscopic surgery that is more reliable and less invasive than current lifting techniques. The novelty of the innovation is affirmed with one issued patent and an additional pending patent application. The device takes advantage of existing suction available in every operating room.  This suction allows for the non-invasive attachment of the lifting device to the abdominal wall.  Current lifting techniques include manually grasping the abdominal wall and using perforating towel clips. Manual grasp does not always provide a secure grip and perforating towel clips invasively perforate abdominal wall tissue to provide a handle by which to lift and elevate. The technical goals of this project focus on creating a minimum viable product produced with biocompatible materials using standard good manufacturing practices for FDA Class I medical devices. Production quality samples will be produced with five different materials to determine which performs best in terms of strength, reliability, and flexibility. These samples will also be used to determine if any further design changes are needed prior to commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address the global challenge of pollution abatement and air purification which have a profound impact on the environment, health, and economy. Hundreds of billions of dollars are spent each year on emission control activities, yet air pollution costs the global economy over five trillion of dollars annually in welfare costs and is attributed to one in every eight deaths. The design and performance of current industrial catalytic air purification technologies is insufficient to treat the growing number of airborne pollutants. Finding sustainable, cost-effective solutions to this problem, and is becoming increasingly important in view of tightening regulations. The technology we propose has a high commercialization potential due to the fact that it is cost-effective, shows excellent long-term performance and potential for scalable fabrication within an existing manufacturing framework within the United States.  Further, the founders of the company are inventors of the technology and have exclusive licensing of the core IP. Significantly, our demonstration of operating temperature reductions has been well-received by industry as evidenced by findings from our customer discovery effort through programs such as NSF I-Corps.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses outstanding challenges in catalytic converters, notably technical challenges associated with cold start, durability, and high cost, which can be attributed to the use of substantial amounts of platinum group metals, and reliance on the limited reserves of these metals. Through highly controlled composition and nano-, micro-, and macro- structuration, we have previously demonstrated dramatically reduced precious metal content in a catalytic decomposition of known pollutants. The research objectives of this SBIR project are to develop a scalable deposition method of these advanced catalytic materials onto industrially relevant substrates, to promote and accelerate their integration into commercial products to tackle the growing problem of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The technical work will involve the synthesis of these materials and modifications to the synthetic schemes in a way that will be compatible with such large-scale deposition processes, as well as longevity, robustness, and catalytic testing. It will require building equipment for the deposition. Overcoming the technological challenges that are the subject of this SBIR Project will facilitate translation of the nanostructured materials to a broad range of catalytic applications related to pollution abatement and air purification.

    synthetic nanomaterials to address the unmet clinical need in promoting infection
    free tissue regeneration in surgical, traumatic, ocular, burn, and chronic wounds.
    While small wounds heal naturally, larger chronic wounds demonstrate delayed wound
    healing with infections, and affect over 6.5 million patients costing over US
    $25 billion annually in treatments. In addition, annually, 2 million Americans
    suffer from serious infections due to drug resistant bacteria resulting in severe
    morbidity, serious complications, huge economic losses with an estimated 23,000
    deaths. As conventional antibiotics are failing, our ability to fight drug resistant
    pathogens is diminishing and the pipeline of new potential antibiotic drugs is
    very skim. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a product that can fight multiple
    pathogens through a mechanism against which bacteria are less likely to develop
    further resistance. Hence, the current project evaluates the feasibility of developing
    a novel, easily handleable dry film with potential to eliminate a variety of infectious
    pathogens while improving wound healing in a single application. This product
    is pliable, easily rehydratable, has intrinsic tissue scaffolding properties and
    is inherently antimicrobial against a broad range of pathogens without the use
    of any additional agents.  \n \nThis SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the
    feasibility of developing a shape retaining, pliable, easily handleable antimicrobial
    cell-scaffolding gel matrix into a product that is simultaneously toxic to antibiotic-resistant
    bacterial strains, while remaining conducive to tissue regeneration. This current
    product has a nano-porous gel matrix that promotes cellular infiltration and attachment
    along with utilizing a charge-based mechanism to lyse bacterial membranes upon
    contact. Although there is on-going research on such self-assembled hydrogels,
    the formation of films using these nanofibers has never been assessed before and
    stands to be the key technological advancement. Thus, this current proposal explores
    two methods for making films such as i) solvent casting methods relying on non-covalent
    crosslinking - where the hydrogel is applied to a surface and then allowed to
    dry into a film overnight, and ii) Covalent crosslinking by - incorporating cysteines
    by oxidizing using H2O2 or crosslinking using Schiff base formation followed by
    reductive deamination. The films so formed will be structurally and functionally
    evaluated for their ability to eliminate infections and biocompatibility.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the increase in efficiency and reduction in cost of gathering information in surface water environments using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). USVs have the potential to increase accessibility to bodies of water, enhance coverage, and make data collection safer by removing humans from the task. However, to fully realize the potential of USVs for gathering information, a level of autonomy with minimal need for human supervision and intervention is required. The development of this technology will open the door to the pervasive use of USVs for environmental data collection, and ultimately benefit society through: i) more information upon which to base decisions about resource management and environmental policy; ii) higher frequency of data collection activities through reduced cost; and iii) increased safety by keeping human personnel out of harsh environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lay the foundation for a transformative approach to environmental data collection in surface waters. The intellectual merit of this project lies in addressing technical challenges that will enable unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to effectively navigate autonomously in complex surface waters that may contain a range of diverse obstacles, which would otherwise be inaccessible or at best require a high degree of human supervision. This will be achieved by advancing the state-of-the-art in computer vision and machine learning toward intelligent obstacle characterization. The proposed framework interprets images or video of obstacles to extract salient features, such as flexibility or rigidity, through the innovative use of machine learning, dimensionality reduction, and tools borrowed from the analysis of collective behavior. This extra layer of information provided through the proposed framework represents a significant advancement in computer vision, which offers direct benefits to environmental monitoring and data collection by empowering USVs with new unmanned capabilities.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project builds a new query engine for K12 that
    addresses four major shortcomings in existing automated question-answering systems.
    The shortcomings prevent both students and teachers from fully leveraging the
    power of such systems. Existing systems 1) cannot handle raw student queries like
    - Ten Ford Fiestas cost $146,000. How much does each Ford Fiesta cost?, 2) do
    not take into account students' skill-levels to return results that is within
    the scope of their understanding, 3) do not have a community vetting and feedback
    mechanism that allows systems to learn the quality of their automated answers,
    and 4) discard valuable insights obtainable from students' queries that can be
    used to inform future classroom instruction. The query engine, which is free to
    use, addresses all four shortcomings, improves classroom instruction and closes
    the achievement gap. It empowers students of all abilities and from all communities
    to obtain automated answers from the AI technology and regular answers from the
    community of users. The community of users on the platform range from students
    to teachers to experts from the industry fulfilling their corporate social responsibilities.
    The platform is compliant with federal and state privacy regulations and is projected
    to earn significant Annual Recurring Revenue from corporations and EdTech companies
    seeking to build their brand among the K12 community. \n\n\nThis project develops
    new skill-aware AI technology that automatically maps student's raw queries into
    topics, sub-topics and intent. The technology considers the user skill-levels
    and automatically constructs an answer extracted from the most relevant educational
    resources, with highest preference given to teachers' own resources. The technology
    does something more if the detected topic falls under Algebra and the intent of
    the query is 'How do I solve this?' It generates, on-the-fly, additional scaffolding
    instructions for solving the problem. This approach extends to disciplines beyond
    Algebra. In addition, Phase I research leverages the latest advancements in Machine
    Learning, Natural Language Processing and Topic Detection to extract and track
    skill-levels, as well as strengths and weaknesses of students for teacher's benefit.
    Finally, the project will also demonstrate the efficacy of the technology in terms
    of queries made, relevant responses generated and its impact in terms of Algebra
    math outcomes.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed
    worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a protein sample preparation kit that eliminates variability and provides researchers with the information they need to find important protein drug targets and biomarkers.  The high throughput protein analysis methods of proteomics are having a significant impact on the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, from the development of new protein-based drugs to quality control monitoring and biomarker discovery to clinical diagnostics. All proteomics applications require robust, repeatable and automatable sample preparation methods. Currently, however, these methods are not standardized. The lack of the standardization often leads to experimental failure and unreliable results, which may require many rounds of experimental repeats, costing time and money. Standardized protein sample preparation kits will provide significant workflow savings, improve time to market, and accelerate biomarker discovery and drug development.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a universal peptide isolation kit to serve the diverse needs of the proteomics community.  Currently, methods for sample preparation typically have more than a dozen steps, are prone to peptide loss and bias, and require more than a day to complete.  Through the NSF I-Corps program, it was discovered that more than 70% of researchers in academia and industry are unhappy with current protein sample preparation methods.  To address this need, a sample preparation kit that increases the speed and efficiency of peptide sample preparation was developed. The approach differs from current methods in three fundamental ways.  First, all manipulations will be done in solution in a single tube with half the number of steps compared to existing protocols. Second, a fast, universal, and reversible chemical tag is employed rather than relying on physical separation, preventing sample loss or bias. Third, a stabilized derivative of trypsin will allow for complete digestion of protein samples followed by efficient removal of intact and fragmented trypsin, preventing contamination.

    This SBIR Phase I project addresses the problem of assessing blood clotting and associated bleeding and thrombosis risks in neonatal and pediatric patients. Existing coagulation analyzers put these patients at further risk because they cannot operate with low volumes of blood, and because they are less reliable owing to the requirement for test sample contact. This project will develop Acoustic Tweezing Thomboelastometry (ATT) for these patients.  Using only a single acoustically-levitated drop of blood, this non-contact technology platform enables safe and reliable assessment of blood clotting in small children and provides an opportunity for development of newborn screening tests for coagulation abnormalities. This technology is the outcome of NSF funding which has supported the training of several PhD students in biomedical and mechanical engineering.  ATT can reduce side effects for neonatal and pediatric patients by using 1/100th the sample volume required by technologies developed for adult healthcare and improve diagnostic response time for critical care providers by up to 350%. This technology could decrease the cost of blood coagulation analysis by over 30%, thus allowing for patients in the United States to save $2.0 billion annually.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops an innovative technology for non-contact blood coagulation analysis that integrates photo-optical and viscoelastic measurements in a single drop of blood (<6uL in volume).  The essence of the ATT technology is to levitate a small sample in a host fluid (e.g., air) by the acoustic radiation force and measure its physical properties under deformation during levitation.  ATT addresses the issue of high variability and poor standardization of existing coagulation analyzers caused by blood sample contact with artificial surfaces. Due to its noncontact feature and low sample volume requirement, ATT can rapidly (<10 minutes) and reliably assess bleeding/thrombotic risks and is sensitive to temporal changes in shear viscosity and elasticity during blood clotting and fibrinolysis.  In addition, ATT can measure platelet function and assess the functional levels of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors. The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly minimal marketable product for the market of pediatric coagulation analyzers. This goal will be achieved by meeting the following three objectives: 1) build the user-friendly prototype; 2) develop integrated software for device control, data acquisition, and data analysis; and 3) calibrate the prototype and standardize it for coagulation measurements.

    soft robotic hand exoskeleton coupled with an interactive 3D virtual reality (VR)
    gaming environment that provides fine motor training for stroke patients' hands.
    There is a currently a lack of available devices that provide fine sensory and
    motor training of the hand. The potential benefit is to fill this niche market
    opportunity, especially when considering the high incidence of hand disability
    due to stroke and other neuromusculoskeletal injuries. This system can provide
    structured therapy sessions which requires minimal therapist supervision while
    improving patient engagement which enhances the broader participation. As a complimentary
    technology for current rehabilitation practice, it has a potential to lower health
    care and labor costs associated with neurological rehabilitation. The outpatient
    physical rehabilitation market is a $30 billion industry growing at a rate of
    7% in the US, mainly due to the growing elderly population. The robot-assisted
    rehabilitation market is expected to grow dramatically, reaching $2 billion by
    2020. As robot-assisted treatment becomes widely available, the customer base
    will grow from acute care clinics to long-term rehabilitation centers and finally
    to home-based care. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project results from the
    combination of a soft robotic system with fine motor control synced to VR games
    for both sensory and motor stimuli. The robotic exoskeleton provides individual
    joint control to practice complex grasping while the VR environment provides targeted
    rehabilitation games. This system addresses the fine motor control needs that
    have not been met by current hand rehabilitation devices, which only offer gross
    motions. Adaptive algorithms will adjust to the patient's level of ability to
    accomplish the assigned tasks in virtual game scenarios, providing accessibility
    for a wide range of population with different levels of severity. There are three
    main goals for the project. First, we will develop a VR environment simulating
    real-world hand motion via interaction with objects in an immersive game. Second,
    we will develop adaptive control algorithms for the soft robotic exoskeleton to
    provide active assistive motion in performing rehabilitation-oriented tasks in
    the VR environment. Third, a pilot study will be conducted with both healthy individuals
    and hand-impaired stroke patients. The Phase I project will produce a system with
    assistive hand motion in a targeted rehabilitation virtual game environment, which
    can be tested for efficacy in a larger clinical population of stroke survivors.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project lays in its ability to enable reconfigurable hardware acceleration in the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Users under constrained power at the edge will be able to choose a new solution that can bring acceleration, and enable datacenter like capabilities, and benefit from the IoT's long-sought promise.  Using Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) to develop a next-generation Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), increasing performance while reducing energy consumption at the sensor node level, is possible. As already experienced in our data driven world, it is critical that we improve our computing capabilities at the edge in order to gain in responsiveness and increase our energy efficiency. With evermore data and performance requirements to deliver on the consumer demands, innovative uses of emerging memories are showing great promise and providing capabilities that will help fulfill the IoT's potential. If fulfilled, this technology has the potential to enable a whole set of data driven applications at the edge, such as low-energy image recognition and learning in drones to operate longer and more effectively or long-lasting medical implants with leading data aggregation and reactiveness.

    This Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will aim to commercialize a patented technology to realize a ultra-low-power Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based on Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM). To handle the data explosion in Internet of Things (IoT) network, the industry is moving towards increasing intelligent analysis capability for single IoT devices. Tight power budget has become a critical road block: high-end solutions, such as multicore CPUs, GPUs, can provide enough computing capability but fail to meet the power budget, while low-power commercial products, such as micro-controllers and low-power FPGAs, can satisfy power constraints but hardly follow the increasing complexity in data analysis algorithms. This project aims to develop a ultra-low-power FPGA that can offer high-performance data analysis capability under IoT-level power limits. This project will prototype a FPGA chip built around an innovative RRAM-based routing multiplexer design. We will also release an associated software tool suite to support the implementation of customer's applications on the technology. Compared to existing commercial solutions, the proposed FPGA product is expected to demonstrate similar computing capability as high-end FPGA solutions while satisfying an IoT power budget (<1W).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the development of monolithic 3D integration of carbon nanotube (CNT) computing in conjunction with silicon nanoelectronics. The value of nanoelectronics utilizing silicon integrated with CNT has been shown to have immense potential through various academic studies. However, the transition of this technology from academia to industry has been stymied by lack of CNT material that meets the manufacturing requirements particularly in terms of alignment, purity, and compatibility to be properly explored. Monolithic 3D integration will enable game-changing levels of improvement to computing speed and power efficiency, creating better computing for all. Providing a material which accelerates research and development for improved computing will create a game changing impact on the $500B integrated circuit market and potentially create billions of dollars in revenue. This project is focused on the needs of the nanoelectronics industry because of the impact possible in that market, but other markets such as biosensing or flexible electronics would benefit from the same materials and often at relaxed specifications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will greatly expand the utilization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in nanoelectronics by making industrially relevant material available. This will allow application oriented nanoelectronics teams to move forward with R&D projects. Further, the project's work on the fundamentals of aligned CNT growth and purification will benefit the CNT materials community by the extension of the material into commercial manufacturing. The research objectives are on two fronts: 1) growth of CMOS compatible aligned CNTs and 2) purification of aligned CNTs. Growth of highly aligned CNT populations has typically utilized catalysts which are not compatible with front end of line CMOS fabrication, hindering the use of material in conjunction with Si integrated circuits. Current methods of CNT purification to remove metallic CNTs suffer from either destroying the critical CNT alignment, utilization of non-CMOS compatible materials, or the need of extensive post-processing. This project will develop a growth process and a purification process that preserves alignment while maintaining CMOS compatibility and utilizes wafer scale batch processes that allow high throughput manufacturing. The purification scheme is a proprietary method which must be characterized and refined to meet the exacting purification standards of 99.99% semiconducting CNTs or better.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of quantum computers that will impact many technologies by enabling, for example, molecular simulations for drug design and catalyst development for energy applications, quantum machine learning, and solving optimization problems such as scheduling. Scalable, universal quantum computing promises to be one of the most transformative technologies of the modern era. The range of applications are broad and will only expand with the development of new quantum algorithms, with one of the biggest opportunities being molecular simulations for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. For example, despite being a multi-billion dollar industry, computational drug discovery is limited by the approximations necessary to make calculations tractable for classical computers. In order to perform these simulations at a scale useful for commercial applications, qubit numbers must be increased several orders of magnitude beyond the state of the art. The proposed innovation of trapping and individual control of neutral atoms will, if successful, enable quantum computers to scale to the thousands of qubits needed for error-corrected, universal quantum computing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop technology for scalable trapping and addressing of neutral atom qubits through dynamic, parallelized optical trapping and individual addressing of alkaline earth qubits. Neutral atoms are an emerging platform for quantum computing and the majority of work thus far has been directed towards alkali atoms (i.e., those with a single valence electron). Alkaline earth atoms have two valence electrons and correspondingly a richer energy level structure, which has demonstrated very long trapped coherence times.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to make organizations more productive by helping them organize operational data in a structured yet accessible way. Today, organizations tend to accumulate such data in spreadsheets, scattered across users and folders, with new copies and revisions being made every time data must be presented, summarized, or integrated in a new way. This leads to tedious cut-and-paste workflows, costly errors, and a lack of reliable information for decision support. This project proposes a general-purpose software solution, based on a recently developed method for interactive database visualization. The system's novelty is in the ease and flexibility with which data can be queried and laid out on the screen, covering a large range of use cases that would previously require custom programming. Applications can be found in all manner of organizations: corporations, non-profits, higher education, science, healthcare, journalism, disaster response, the military, public administration, and so on.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a general-purpose, user-friendly software product that individuals within an organization can use to store and share structured data along with the various data displays through which said data is viewed, queried, and edited. Such data displays could include arbitrary database queries, visualizations such as crosstabs, calendars, and bar charts, as well as non-tabular multi-query visualizations such as forms, dashboards, and hierarchical reports. Using the proposed software, organizations can decrease time spent on administrative and managerial tasks, improve the use of data in decision-making, and, in many cases, eliminate yearlong internal software development projects.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the productivity and environmental sustainability of soybean cultivation. Soybean is the most widely grown crop in the United States with nearly 90 million acres under cultivation. Soybean is a key part of the food system and generates $22 billion in export revenue each year. One of the greatest threats to soybean production is the fungal pathogen known as Asian Soybean Rust. Current commercial soybean varieties have no resistance to this pathogen and over $2 billion is spent annually on fungicides to control this disease. While soybean is highly susceptible to this disease, many wild plant species have natural resistance to this pathogen. This project seeks to identify the naturally occurring mechanisms of disease resistance in wild plant species that can be used to develop disease-resistant soybean varieties. Adoption of these varieties is expected to bring more than $4 billion in value to the soybean industry while improving productivity and reducing fungicide use.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to identify plant immune receptor proteins that confer disease resistance to Asian Soybean Rust, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi. A key determinant of whether or not a plant is resistant to a particular pathogen is whether the plant has an appropriate immune receptor protein capable of recognizing the presence of the invading pathogen. Once activated, plant immune receptors trigger plant defense responses that typically result in immunity. This project will use reverse genetic and biochemical approaches to identify plant immune receptor proteins that confer resistance to Asian Soybean Rust. Preliminary work identified several molecules from Phakopsora that elicit an immune response in non-host plant species. The goal is to identify the cognate immune receptors and test them for sufficiency to enable immune activation in response to Asian Soybean Rust elicitor molecules. This research will enable future work to the development soybean varieties with resistance to Asian Soybean Rust.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of new fluorescent materials that will provide new color technologies to the paint, polymer, and ink industries. These new materials will overcome the undesirable properties of commercial fluorescent pigments, like a tendency to rapidly fade, give weak color strength, and degrade during processing. Besides giving fabrics, packaging, and toys bright, attractive colors, improvements to fluorescent pigments could change several parts of daily life: Brighter paints and signs could improve road and airport safety. Product designers for next-generation consumer electronics will have a new color palette for their newest gadget. Agricultural scientists would have a new tool to study crop treatments. As a result, success in this research project has the potential to claim a share of the multi-billion dollar colorant market, disrupt expectations around fluorescent pigments, bring new products to consumers, and create high-tech jobs. In addition, this project leverages collaboration with academic partners, supporting science and entrepreneurship education of university students and postdoctoral fellows.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project provides a revolutionary solution to a problem that has haunted chemistry for more than 150 years. Existing fluorescent materials are formulated with pigments that have thinly dispersed colorants, which dilutes their color and makes them susceptible to degradation. This is done by necessity, because fluorescent dyes have a tendency to aggregate, causing unwanted color changes and loss of the fluorescence effect. This solution utilizes a bottom-up "self-assembly" strategy to eliminate aggregation and create stable fluorescent solids that maximize the longevity and boldness of the color. This research will study this novel class of fluorescent pigment to gauge its resistance to fading, improved chromaticity, and material performance in realistic conditions. This will be done by measuring changes to fluorescence intensity and color appearance under natural and laboratory-accelerated weathering conditions, and creating test "products" in the form of paints and polymers. These test materials are expected to have stronger color for longer periods of time while still being amenable to commercial processing techniques. In addition, this project is an opportunity to study the behavior of self-assembling materials inside polymer formulations, which is a new research area with broad scientific and commercial potential.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable Fortify to provide U.S. manufacturers with a disruptive manufacturing technology to create low-volume tooling parts with order of magnitude reductions in lead times and part price. U.S. manufacturers rely on prototype and low-volume production parts that are currently produced using aluminum soft tooling that need to be precision machined. Prices for these small run parts can reach USD $10,000 or more per tool, depending on complexity, with lead times extending weeks or months. This results in high unit costs when parts are produced in low volumes. Industry data suggests the market for outsourced prototype and low volume injection molded parts with physical dimensions serviceable by Fortify technology may be as large as USD $2.7 Billion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will enable Fortify to create a thermal competitive advantage to enable customer discovery in the field of low-volume injection molding tooling. Despite the noise in the field of 3D printing, disrupting the injection molding tooling industry has remained elusive due to the lasting need for high strength, thermal stability, fatigue resistance, and smooth mold finish in 3D printed molds. Fortify is uniquely positioned to address these technical challenges by leveraging novel materials, patented manufacturing hardware, and proprietary manufacturing software. Fortify prints ceramic-filled, high-temperature resins that are locally textured by magnetic fields in customized magnetic printers to produce optimum ceramic microstructures designed by Fortify's INFORM software to maximize the thermomechanical performance of the printed parts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project pertains to the novel production of short-fiber reinforced thermoplastic material applicable to a range of processes, with the added benefit of utilizing  high quality, low cost recycled or recovered fibers. The beachhead application is in a powder-based additive manufacturing system capable of mid-scale manufacturing that can bridge between prototype-stage and capital-intensive injection molded economy-of-scale manufacturing. Such systems can be located in regional production hubs to accelerate new or highly-customizable products to market. The inclusion of the proposed additives in these systems will expand the range of end-product material properties available, and thereby expand the potential client pool for the same platform. Anticipated flow properties of the material will position it as an accessible additive option for other 3D printing technologies as well as the much larger-market of injection molding processing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project adapts a processing technology that is yet untapped for this application, to produce a composite thermoplastic additive for polymeric powder feedstock 3D printing. This additive is expected to increase stiffness, strength, and thermal stability of the end product, while reducing weight and providing superior handling characteristics during production relative to existing alternatives. The project is focused on identifying process conditions required to produce a nominally conforming product, followed by testing that characterizes the material and handling properties. Results of these tests will be compared against acceptance standards published by the beachhead additive manufacturing system supplier in preparation for inclusion into 3D printed test components.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a coating product with superior durability and antifouling performance in the targeted environmental-friendly marine coating market. This innovative solution requires a less frequent application and reduces the amount of subaquatic growth on the hull of ships and static objects in bodies of water. Potential economic benefits include improving fuel efficiency and saving the maintenance cost of ships and static marine structures. At the same time, this product provides enormous environmental benefits by reducing the greenhouse gas emission from cargo ships and avoiding the potential species invasion caused by current marine coatings. In particular, this product is the first non-biocide environmentally friendly product of its kind. It addresses the current and future needs highlighted by global regulations to replace the existing harmful biocide-leaching coatings with an eco-friendly solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and commercialize a novel marine coating product to deliver a high-performing eco-friendly antifouling solution that is currently lacking in the marketplace. Current self-polishing coating products were subject to increasing regulatory restriction, while alternative environmental-friendly option such as fouling-release coating suffered low antifouling performance. This novel coating technology potentially achieves the durability and high antifouling performance for targeted marine applications, and the eco-friendly feature without leaching biocide into the aqueous environment. The objective of this project is to explore the key fabrication factors in coating formulation and identify their impacts on the coating stability and antifouling performance. Critical knowledge will be obtained enables the development of prototype product showing year-long reliability and top marine antifouling function.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make talent search faster and much more effective. More specifically, it will aim to make it easier to connect open jobs with the talents of job seekers. The innovation proposed here will redefine job search in a time when the labor market is in major flux, and the technology developed in this project will enable job searching to move far beyond a one-page resume and focus more on the skills needed to succeed in a job. In so doing, the innovation will enable job seekers to find new opportunities that are aligned with their career interests and enable employers to find skilled talent matched to their project needs. Employers using this technology will be able to search for talent according to what they need performed, without necessarily knowing how the task will be performed. Similarly, job seekers will be able to search for jobs that they may not have known existed but are still strongly aligned with their career goals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a skills-to-tasks matching system that serves as a basis for which worker skills are employed to perform which tasks on the job. Currently, available data on the skill content of occupations does not capture variation across industries, geographies, or over time. Nor does it capture the applicability of a worker's current skills to new workplace tasks, an important consideration for up-skilling and re-training programs. This limitation has left a major source of information asymmetry intact in the 21st century job market, where the most effective talent search strategy remains peer-referrals. This same lack of granularity in available data has limited the effectiveness of policymakers to measure the skills-gap, identify career pathways, and design training programs most needed in their local economies. The research proposed in this project will produce an up-to-date compendium of the skills and work activities that are evolving in the labor market and map the relationships between them. This technology will provide a dynamic and granular view of the labor market and improve the quality of information available to decision-makers in industry, education, workforce development, as well as for the study of the future of work.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a novel wearable device for unobtrusively detecting changes in the lung health of patients with chronic respiratory disease. This Passive Unobtrusive Lung function Monitor (PULMO) will be the only device that can automatically measure a patient's lung health information without requiring any active engagement from the clinician, and without imposing any obtrusive changes to the patient's daily routine. The PULMO is useful in a broad range of respiratory disease applications, such as lung transplant post-operative care, asthma management and respiratory therapy research, that require continuous, objective and unobtrusive monitoring of lung function change. Since PULMO technology is compatible with low-cost microcontrollers, it has the potential to dominate the spirometry market and respiratory clinical trials space with high-volume production. The spirometry market has an expected CAGR of 9.4 % from 2018 to 2025, reaching a $1.4 billion market value by 2025, while clinical trials expenditures on new respiratory therapy drugs is forecast to reach $1.7 billion in 2025.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the major drawback of the state-of-the-art in continuous monitoring of respiratory disease, which is that it demands daily discipline, effort and proper technique of the patient, resulting in missing, invalid or fabricated data. In this project, a manufactured PULMO test device will be implemented with an intelligent event detection unit combined with a low power microcontroller, and the total average power consumption will be less than 300 microWatts. The measurement error of the PULMO will be within +/- 5 %, which is necessary for detecting changes in lung impairment. The intelligent event detection unit will be implemented as a nonlinear dynamical system in a custom integrated circuit. A gated recurrent neural network that is optimized for embedded low resource systems will be implemented in the low power microcontroller and will be used to detect respiratory disease symptoms. Controlled tests will be performed with a silicone phantom chest to evaluate the measurement accuracy of the PULMO device.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving crop yields, while reducing the amount of pesticides used. By significantly improving the accuracy and timeliness of insect surveillance, we will allow more effective pest management, allowing the applications of insect interventions to be targeted in space and time. For example, rather than a blanket spraying of harsh pesticides across the entire field, our system could suggest spraying of a milder (and cheaper) pesticide in just a few "hot spots", at the optimal time of day. Reducing the volume of pesticides has further positive benefits to society at large, it will reduce pollution, and the use of pesticides has been implicated as a contributor to climate change and to colony collapse disorder. The hardware/algorithms/representations/data-models created in this project have an obvious application to mosquito surveillance, which has implications for control of insect vectored diseases of both humans and livestock. The commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is obvious. Insects damage or destroy about 150 billion dollars' worth of crops each year. If we prevent reduce this by just one percent, we have a billion-dollar market.

    The proposed project will investigate techniques to improve the state-of-the-art in flying insect classification, with the goal of producing a platform that allows insect surveillance for precision agriculture. In particular, we will take the current algorithms and representations (many of which were invented by the current PIs) and make them invariant to the wide range of conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity) encountered in the field. The company's research has shown that without creating such invariances, the variability induced by changing environment conditions will swamp the regularities in the features that are currently exploited by classification algorithms, and reduce the accuracy to random guessing. It is well understood how temperature, pressure, humidity effect air density, and how air density effects insect flight. However, the current models treat the insects as idealized objects using aerospace equations for density vs. lift and completely ignore the effects of the environment on insect physiology. The company plans to achieve this by creating a model that compensates for environmental conditions. To achieve these ambitious goals, they plan to use machine learning to learn the appropriate invariances and model corrections.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop an enzyme immobilization platform
    to be used in the production of biopharmaceuticals and other biomanufacturing
    processes to reduce the timeline and cost associated with discovering and manufacturing
    biotherapeutics.  Biopharmaceutical sales have soared in recent years and healthcare
    authorities have increased pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce
    the cost of biologics leaving pharmaceutical engineers to focus on reducing bioproduction
    costs.  To accomplish this goal, pharmaceutical companies are aggressively investigating
    continuous processing technologies to reduce the capital and other costs associated
    with biopharmaceutical manufacture. The immobilization platform described in this
    proposal will provide a technology that is compatible with continuous processing
    strategies to reduce the timeline and cost associated with discovering and manufacturing
    biotherapeutics.  In addition, this platform has the potential to reduce the cost
    and increase the efficiency of biomanufacturing processes across several other
    industries including food, leather, and textiles. \n\nThe intellectual merit of
    this SBIR Phase I project is to develop pH responsive immobilized enzymes for
    the production of biopharmaceuticals. There are three key technical challenges
    associated with this project: The immobilized-enzyme must demonstrate pH responsive
    behavior compatible with biologics manufacture (pH 6-7); mass transfer of protein
    substrates must be comparable to the native enzyme; and extended shelf-life of
    the immobilized-enzyme is required for long-term storage. To mitigate these challenges,
    this project aims to covalently bind an enzyme to a pH responsive polymer that
    is formulated to have reversible solubility near neutral pH. The solubility of
    the immobilized-biocatalyst can be tightly controlled within a specified pH range
    allowing for continuous processing and facile purification of the biotherapeutic
    product. Poor mass transfer often results from immobilizing biocatalysts on solid
    supports. These challenges are further exaggerated in bioconjugation reactions
    because the coupling partner, a protein, is generally more affected by sterics
    than small molecules. Therefore, fabrication of the solid support will be explored
    to produce resins of varied size, morphologies, and dissolution properties that
    are compatible with macromolecule functionalization. Additionally, the immobilized
    enzyme generated in this project can be utilized under soluble conditions, which
    combines the positive attributes of both immobilization and soluble enzyme catalysis.
    The final challenge of developing a commercially viable shelf-life of the catalyst
    will be addressed through development of novel drying protocols. Shelf-stable
    immobilized enzymes will be developed so that inventory can be maintained without
    requiring long lead times for catalyst production.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to transform the culture of photosynthetic aquatic microorganisms. Although microalgae and cyanobacteria have high volumetric productivities, the cultures cannot be too deep, due to restrictions of light penetration.  This proposed technology removes the light penetration limit inherent in current technologies. The results of this project will allow the production of medical and food grade biomass in controlled conditions, as the light source will not be connected to the exterior of the culture reactors. This approach will provide the advantages of a fermentation production using phototrophic species, without the need to supply organic carbon. The photosynthetic biomass production makes use of carbon dioxide and light for growth. This project will result in a microalgal/cyanobacterial biomass production in areas where it is not currently feasible and with higher productivity. The increase of the depth of the cultures two, five or more times of what is currently possible, practically reduces the area required for biomass production. A reduction of cost will improve the economic outlook for microalgal-based commodity products, including feed, food, fuels, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals and lower the environmental impact.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses one of the most significant problems found in achieving the promise of microalgae and cyanobacteria as source of food, fuels and other products is the limitation of light penetration. Most outdoor cultures are limited to less than 60 cm depth. In reactors with artificial light, besides the light penetration high electrical costs limit their use to high value products.  This project will result in a light system that takes advantage of the water movement in cultures to generate electricity for LED lights in untethered units that move with the culture. The proposed generator uses methods more efficient and lighter that traditional electromagnetic and piezoelectric generators. The developed energy harvester can be used in other applications such as power for water quality monitoring and other sensing equipment. In this phase, a unit with a miniaturized energy harvester coupled with passive switching, charging, discharging and rectifying modules in the same substrate, in a waterproof casing will be developed. Data proof of the suitability of these units to support photosynthetic microorganisms? biomass production will be obtained. The results will inform further development of the units in a future phase.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from developing technology to enable enterprise, cloud, academic, and government network operators to cost-effectively scale computer clusters to support the growing demands on these systems. Computer clusters underpin an increasingly broad range of services that businesses, researchers, and society have come to rely on, from machine learning systems to online social media platforms. Companies increasingly use computer clusters to gain a competitive advantage and accelerate product development. Today's networking technologies improve in performance by a factor of two every two years, but the demand placed on cluster computing systems is growing more than twice that fast in some market segments. The technology developed through this project is well-positioned to exceed the cost and performance scaling limitations of current networking technology, enabling business and scientific end-users to find solutions to more complex problems more quickly.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates the feasibility of a network interconnect for computer clusters that routes traffic through transparent optical switches. Optical switches remove communication bottlenecks in the network fabric but require fundamental changes in how distributed applications communicate information across the network compared to present-day technologies. The commercial success of the technology depends on its ability to accelerate the execution of common distributed applications while providing the interoperability, reliability, and manageability expected by network operators. This project aims to demonstrate a 2x improvement in the execution speed of network-bound applications compared to today's technologies. The proposed research to reach this goal includes developing and optimizing the software stack necessary to interface commodity applications with the fabric, quantifying the performance of those applications subject to the constraints imposed by optical switching, and optimizing the optical switch design to maximize application performance at a system level.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop an alternative source of pharmaceutical heparin using engineered cultured mammalian cells. Heparin is a widely prescribed anticoagulant (blood thinner), critical for surgical operations and for patients that otherwise have risks of blood clotting. Over 300,000 doses are administered per year in the US alone. Currently, heparin is prepared from animal tissues, primarily pig intestines in China, which has regulatory agencies in the US and other countries concerned. For one reason, heparin manufacturing is difficult to regulate in China as evidenced by the heparin adulteration crisis in 2008 that led to allergic reactions and over 250 deaths worldwide. In addition, there is concern that the Chinese pig population will not be able to keep up with the increasing demand. The FDA is considering reintroducing heparin produced from beef cattle as an alternative source, however, bovine heparin is still subject to complications involving animal tissues and it has different anticoagulant properties, which complicates dosing. The current proposal develops cell-based production in which the entire supply chain can be under GMP control and scalable as needed with no dependence on the number and health of an animal population.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to genetically engineer cells to produce a heparin product that can be manufactured for pharmaceutical use. Cellular production can be entirely under GMP control, and cell engineering provides opportunities to produce heparin with improved properties. A survey of clinicians that use heparin overwhelmingly identified heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) as a serious detrimental side effect. HIT can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart attack and loss of life and limb. Treatment is complicated and expensive. HIT is an allergic reaction caused when heparin binds to a specific protein in the blood called platelet factor 4 (PF4). PF4 binding depends on elements of heparin structure that are not involved in heparin's anticoagulant activities. Through cell engineering, heparin molecules with an altered structure will be produced that have reduced affinities for PF4, while maintaining potent anticoagulant properties. In addition, heparin has demonstrated efficacy in other areas such as inflammation and cancer that are not involved in blood clotting. Through cell engineering, heparin structures also could be tailored for these additional applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a new class of high affinity compounds that would be small enough to be delivered into challenging environments such as living cells. Inhibitors of disease-related proteins are central to modern therapeutics across the spectrum of diseases, from cancer to autoimmune diseases, to viral infections, and even to certain hereditary disorders.  Many of these drivers of disease are transcription factors or signal-transduction molecules, yet these proteins are commonly thought of as "undruggable," due to a lack of small pockets for drug binding or due to large protein-protein interaction interfaces. This proposal is aimed at developing an easily screenable library, consisting of DNA-encoded peptidomimetics, whose members have the necessary properties to inhibit these "yet-to-be-drugged" proteins.  Of highest commercial importance, these compounds could address many of the currently "undruggable" molecular drivers of diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to create a DNA-encoded library of constrained peptidomimetic compounds. Current DNA-encoded libraries are primarily limited to small molecules (DNA-encoded chemical libraries; DECLs) or to natural amino acids in the context of translated-protein display (e.g., phage display or mRNA display). In contrast, member molecules of this library will have a much larger binding surface than current small molecules from DECLs, and will be both protease resistant and have a wide range of chemical side chains, unlike the natural peptides from phage display. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to synthesize compounds with conformational rigidity along with parallel DNA encoding.  A library of these compounds could be screened to discover new therapeutic candidates (human and veterinary), life sciences research tools, and heat-resistant diagnostic reagents.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    project is to make unique properties of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) widely available to
    developers. In doing so, the company will empower developers to create novel distributed services with
    trustworthy and consistent shared state operations that will lead to more transparent business
    and governance practices. In the Phase I tools will lead to new innovative meat
    distribution businesses in Bozeman, MT. In the long term, we aim to build the fundamental tools
    for the growing ranks of blockchain developers, who need powerful and easy-to-integrate tools
    that access and manipulate DLT state. Ultimately, our suite of services will provide a unified
    interface to multiple DLT implementations and facilitate the trustworthy exchange of shared
    state among different applications to create a wide and consistent view of world state.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an ecosystem of tools to operate on shared
    application state stored on DLTs and to roll out these tools as they mature. The ultimate goal is
    to provide a unified API much like that of leading cloud service providers, which consists of
    several incrementally introduced services.
    Specifically, the services planned to provide are:
    1. Blocky Valve - A JavaScript API that simplifies DLT read and write access.
    2. Blocky Pipes - A DLT data delivery microservice based on message queues connected
    to Blocky Valve.
    3. Blocky Loading Ramp - A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service
    of smart contracts.
    4. Blocky Cement - An oracle service for exchanging data across DLTs using
    consensus-based provenance. Cement will also enable interaction between smart
    contracts across different DLTs.
    5. Blocky Crates - A database-like query interface to data stored on DLTs. Crates will also
    enable smart contracts to interact with up-to-date shared application state stored on
    DLTs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop the first low-cost and integrated onboard charger and auxiliary power module for electric vehicles, facilitating deployment of next-generation electrified transportation systems. It is noteworthy that there are more than 250 million registered passenger vehicles in the U.S. Over 40% of greenhouse gases and 70% of emissions come from the transportation sector, and transportation is 99% dependent on one source of fuel: petroleum. Mainstream adoption of electric vehicles is essential if the U.S. is to gain energy security and substantially reduce carbon emissions. The electric car industry has passed its tipping point; however, electric vehicles are still in the very early stages of development. Like early computers, the pieces that make up an electric car are large, heavy, costly and unable to efficiently communicate amongst themselves. The proposed technology not only reduces the volume, cost, and weight of onboard chargers for electric vehicles, but also enhances their efficiencies, and enables bidirectional operation to support future Smart Grid functionalities. This project will lead to creating jobs once the technology matures toward commercialization.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to design and development of an innovative integrated and bidirectional onboard charger for electric vehicles. Currently, all the upcoming and commercially available electric vehicles are equipped with an individual onboard charger to charge traction batteries and an additional auxiliary power module to power auxiliary loads. These converters are heavy, bulky, costly and need to communicate over a variety of controller area networks. The intellectual merit of this project is in the innovative topology, design, control, development, packaging, and validation of the first charger which integrates an onboard charger and an auxiliary power module. This SBIR Phase I project involves the design of the converter, investigation and design of the controller, design and implementation of the electromagnetic interference filter stage, creating the schematics and layout, thermal management, reliability analyses, enclosure design, and final alpha prototype assembly and verification. This important work will (1) lead to theoretical advancements in the design, control, and integration of power electronic converters, (2) involve interdisciplinary research in power electronics, control, packaging, and thermal management, and (3) lead to commercialization of the first integrated onboard charger and auxiliary power module for electric vehicles.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a cost-effective, high-performance anticorrosive coating for protecting metal structures, particularly in marine environments. High value assets that are essential parts of the US energy infrastructure, such as offshore oil and gas platforms, marine ships and wind turbines, are exposed to one of the most corrosive environments with direct exposure to salt water via immersion and seawater spray. Corrosion of these metal structures is estimated to cost the world economy around $2.3 trillion in maintenance and replacement capital every year. This project's superhydrophobic coating has the potential to significantly reduce both cost and waste by improving structural safety, reducing maintenance frequency and lengthening the operating lifetime of such vital assets. It will also reduce the environmental impact of corrosion protection systems by using less harmful materials, negating coating repainting needs and extending metal lifetime.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to make a durable, superhydrophobic, high-performance anticorrosive coating through creation of dual-function coating additives. Coatings and corrosion inhibitors are generally the first line of defense in this fight against corrosion. Highly-water repellent superhydrophobic coatings are leading contenders for delivering a step change in corrosion protection performance. However, current solutions suffer from two notable issues: high cost and low durability in highly corrosive marine environments. Existing superhydrophobic coatings require complex and expensive equipment and materials. In addition, these coatings are easily damaged during use, resulting in the loss of their water repellency and corrosion protection ability. The key innovation of this project is a novel dual-function additive that can impart coatings with both superhydrophobicity (passive corrosion protection) and on-demand corrosion inhibitors release (active corrosion protection). This additive based approach results in a durable coating that retains its protective abilities even through significant use and abrasion and enables adaptation to many other coating applications, even ones outside of corrosion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in contributing towards the global effort in minimizing food spoilage and combating world hunger. The worldwide cold-chain freight and logistics industry deals with the storage and transportation of more than 100 million metric tons of fresh produce annually. In this industry, there is currently an urgent need to continuously monitor the air quality in shipping containers where large volumes of perishable food items (fresh fruits and vegetables) are stored. Poor environmental conditions in these containers such as unregulated or high temperatures and low humidity can trigger early ripening of fruits and vegetables, leading to the efflux of specific volatile organic compounds; predominantly ethylene. Due to large volume of produce stored in these containers, if gone unchecked, the environment inside can quickly accumulate high levels of ethylene leading to accelerated ageing and subsequently spoilage. As one can imagine, an appropriate gas sensing technology to continuously monitor ethylene levels would allow adaptive climate control inside the containers, thereby ensuring produce freshness on arrival and preventing billions of dollars in loss and reducing food waste.

    This SBIR phase I project proposes to develop a low-cost ethylene sensing technology using bulk silicon transistor technology (also called CS-FET or chemical sensitive field effect transistor), for mass-deployment in refrigerated containers transporting fresh produce to different parts of the world. This innovation will address an unmet need in the cold-chain logistics industry where continuous monitoring of fruits and vegetables is required to ensure quality and freshness on-arrival. Existing technologies are either too expensive or have poor sensitivity for deployment in large-scale sensing operations. Specifically, Phase I seeks to identify and engineer a sensitive nanoscale catalyst/sensing-layer that will respond to ethylene. To develop the ethylene sensing layers, this effort will pursue the screening of various nanomaterial systems such as ultra-thin layers of noble and transition metals, their composites, sub-oxides, as well as polymeric films using the silicon CS-FET as the backbone technology platform. Additionally, the proposal will also seek to develop a scientific understanding of the interaction mechanism between ethylene and the target sensing layer at both standard ambient conditions as well as conditions prevalent in reefer containers, i.e. low temperature and high humidity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit manufacturers of residual gas analyzers, mass spectrometers, ion-mobility spectrometers, time-of-flight spectrometers and related instruments. Implementation of these sensors will increase the revenue, revenue streams and market share of commercial manufacturers of mass spectrometers by significantly lowering production cost, and by enabling penetration into new markets that require increased sensitivity, lowered size, weight, power consumption, and instrument complexity. The product, if successful, will lead to analytical tools that can substantially benefit the needs of education/research, space, bio/health, agricultural, defense and security markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop nanotechnology-based chip-scale ion sensors with ultra-high intrinsic charge-to-current amplification factors. This patent-pending technology allows semiconductor-processable miniaturization and scalability, sub-microwatt intrinsic power draw, and robust ambient-pressure-agnostic operation. With reduced size, weight, and power requirements, increased sensitivity and dynamic range, these sensors can potentially replace expensive, bulky, and/or high-power-consuming charged particle detectors such as microchannel plates, Daly detectors, electron-multiplier tubes and Faraday cups. The ability to operate under any ambient pressure and distinguish charge polarity can significantly enhance field-portability, turnkey operations, and enhance analytical reach of ion-sensing-based applications. Specifically, the proposed research will seek to overcome the challenges related to generation of high signal responses (by enhancing the electronic transport parameters), high ion-sensor interaction (by optimizing sensor design), and lower readout noise (by optimizing materials and design).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that enabling processing thin glass substrates for next generation communications and packaging needs will mean faster communications with improved power efficiency.  Society has an ever-expanding need for data, due to technologies such as mobile communications, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the shift of communication to higher frequencies (1s-10s of GHz).  As the frequency increases, traditional material choices, such as silicon, can experience very high losses and therefore there is increasing interest in using insulating materials, such as glass, to improve power efficiency.  Similarly, as device size is also important, ability to process thin materials is also critical.  Successful completion of this work will enable cost-effective processing of thin glass substrates and enable next generation communication initiatives impacting commercial, military and industrial markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is proposed to enable processing thin glass substrates in high volume environments.  There has been substantial interest in using glass for next generation RF and packaging solutions for many years due to its advantageous material properties, and scalability.  Of particular interest is the dielectric properties, which provide low electrical loss solutions relative to incumbent materials such as silicon.  Furthermore, the smoothness, hermetic properties and scalability of glass provides additional advantages over materials such as ceramics and organic laminates.  There has been a lot of progress in establishing processes to form thin glass and make precision through glass vias (TGV), as well as demonstrating advantaged functional performance in a lab environment.  There has been a challenge to establish the ability to scale to high volume for thin glass solutions due to gaps in the supply chain.  This SBIR project will establish a process that enables a carrier solution using a silicon carrier that will allow processing of glass in existing infrastructure making thin glass solutions available to the current well established and capable supply chain.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve high-risk pregnancy care and preterm
    labor detection by developing a noninvasive, low-cost, point-of-care wearable
    electronic patch for pregnancy monitoring in both clinical and home environments.
    Each year, 4 million women give birth in the US. More than one in ten of pregnancies
    is considered high-risk, where the mother, fetus, or newborn has elevated risk
    of experiencing an adverse health condition. The proposed platform will allow
    doctors to remotely monitor and manage high-risk pregnancies and intervene, as
    needed, upon detection of labor or other potential complications. By enhancing
    early detection of fetal well-being and increasing access to care, the device
    will allow for improved healthcare delivery, thus increasing mother and infant
    safety, preventing maternal and neonatal morbidities, and lowering healthcare
    costs. By applying machine learning to what could become the largest and most
    comprehensive dataset on maternal and fetal health, the proposed platform could
    become a valuable resource to researchers to identify underlying causes and biomarkers
    of preterm birth. Primary end users are women with high-risk pregnancies, and
    elevated risk of preterm birth. Target customers are hospitals, health care providers
    and insurance companies. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
    I project seeks to develop an unprecedented means to support advances in maternal
    and fetal health: a state-of-the-art miniaturized mobile monitor that discretely
    sticks onto the mother's abdomen and uses sensors to noninvasively monitor fetal
    heart rate (FHR) and other physiological parameters in home and clinical environments.
    The device communicates to a smartphone, which acts as gateway to send data to
    a cloud-based platform, where the data is collected, stored and analyzed, with
    doctors able to set notification thresholds. For this project, patch technology,
    proven to effectively measure uterine activity and fetal movement will be leveraged
    to develop a disruptive product capable of detecting FHR as early as 25 weeks
    gestation. Miniaturization, power consumption and cost levels necessary for deployment
    in remote settings will be achieved. A usability study of the prototype monitor
    will then be conducted in expectant women in hospital settings, followed by an
    equivalency study to validate accuracy of the prototype compared to cardiotocogram,
    the current clinical gold standard. This solution will increase specificity of
    FHR testing, and improve interpretation of monitoring data, as well as aggregate
    data to train AI models to predict adverse events such as preterm birth.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase I project will help to address a critical need for patients who have suffered an infection in a total knee replacement joint.  Unfortunately, doctors have few good options for effectively treating this type of infection to avoid the potential for limb amputation or even death should the infection persist and spread.  Today, treatment requires surgical replacement of part or all of the existing implant while using oral or intravenous antibiotics.  Due to the capsule around the joint (isolated from blood vessels) these methods deliver marginal amounts of antibiotic within the knee where the bacteria reside.  Patients suffer elongated treatment, many times without the use of their knee, waiting for the bacterial infection to slowly resolve.   ForCast Orthopedics' Antibiotic Dispensing Knee Spacer provides a refillable reservoir within the artificial knee that can distribute antibiotic directly into the knee capsule for effective infection treatment.  Physicians can prescribe the antibiotic most appropriate for the bacteria diagnosed.  The patient returns to the doctor's office once per week for a checkup and antibiotic refill injection until the infection is cured.  No follow up surgery is required. Duplicating the antibiotic delivery of previous successful clinical studies (using representative but intolerable daily injections) should result in similar highly successful patient outcomes, reduced patient suffering and reduced healthcare costs.

    This SBIR Phase I project addresses an underserved clinical need for improved treatment of Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI).  Today, doctors have few good options for treatment to avoid the potential for limb amputation or even death should PJI persist and spread.  All methods require surgical debridement and replacement of part or all of the existing implant (to reduce bacterial load) while using oral or intravenous antibiotics that cannot reach the remaining bacteria within the knee capsule (blood/synovial fluid barrier). Temporary eluting antibiotic spacers and beads are too short lived. Patients suffer elongated treatment, many times without a load-bearing knee.  ForCast Orthopedics is developing an Antibiotic Dispensing Spacer (AD Spacer) to replace the standard spacer in a total knee implant.  The AD Spacer provides a refillable reservoir to hold the antibiotic of choice for the bacteria identified and a delivery system to maintain a therapeutic concentration within the knee for the entire therapy duration, typically a minimum of 6 weeks. As a permanent spacer, no further surgery is required after treatment.  Emulating the delivery characteristics of previously successful clinical studies (using intolerable daily injections) should result in similar highly successful patient outcomes, reduced morbidity and reduced total cost of care.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a single beam ion source that enables the manufacturing of high-quality thin film materials and related products. Thin films have a significant impact on quality of life as they are used widely in semiconductor devices, displays, solar panels, tribological coatings, cell phones, optical filters, and micro-electro-mechanical systems. The annual market of these industry segments exceeds $600 billion and has been steadily increasing. Common methods to produce thin films include physical and chemical vapor depositions, which today have tradeoffs between film quality and manufacturability. A high deposition rate results in loosely packed atoms and subsequently unstable materials properties. Producing high-quality dense films today requires slow deposition at elevated temperatures leading to high manufacturing cost and other limitations, such as inability to use flexible substrates. Ion sources are plasma generation devices that enable ion beams to interact with materials at the atomic level and efficiently produce dense films. The single beam ion sources bring in multiple benefits for thin film fabrication, including superior stability, improved adhesion, low electrical resistivity, high optical transmittance, and smooth surfaces.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the technical and commercial feasibilities of the single beam ion sources particularly suitable for fabricating high-quality thin films and devices. In ion beam assisted thin-film deposition, ions simultaneously interact with the atoms as they are deposited from another source. The ions transfer kinetic energies to the surface atoms so that they can move around to form densely packed films. The single beam ion sources proposed in this project can produce a highly focused beam of ions with tunable energy for optimal processing of the growing films. These unique features are enabled by an innovative design of the electromagnetic fields, which efficiently generate plasmas and extract the ions in a narrow beam. Unlike the conventional racetrack type ion sources, the single beam ion sources can accurately control the ion incident angle, which has strong effects on the surface morphology of the deposited film.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a widely applicable, innovative pipeline for drug discovery against rare genetic disorders. While each orphan disease affects a small fraction of individuals, thousands exist, affecting 400 million people world-wide. The challenge to bring therapies to the clinics for diseases that currently have no cure, which is coupled with an expanding market.  Orphan drug sales are expected to reach $262 billion in 2024.  Over the last few years, organoids made from human embryonic stem cells have raised the possibility of understanding the mechanisms leading to a genetic disorder by reconstituting, in vitro, a similar arrangement of the specific cell populations that are implicated in a certain disease. By comparing organoids made from healthy cells to those carrying the associated genetic mutation, drug testing may be performed in vitro to discover new therapeutics. However, this potential has not been harnessed due to technical limitations. In this proposal, as a necessary step towards this goal, the plan is to develop the analytical tools based on machine learning algorithms that will allow the analysis of drug therapeutic potential and toxicity when applied to organoid cultures.

    The intellectual merit of this STTR Phase I project is to develop and validate an unbiased analytical scheme to quantify the results of high-throughput phenotypic screens performed on micropattern organoids. Organoids have the potential to revolutionize the pre-clinical part of the drug discovery pipeline as they provide unbiased endpoints, they are disease relevant, and sensitive to toxicity. However, the use of multi-cellular organization in a high-throughput platform requires analysis of large amounts of information-rich microscopy images. The tools developed in this proposal will allow turning the biological complexity of tissue scale phenotypes into information predictive of the clinical potential of a compound. In the first aim, the goal is to demonstrate that the proposed method allows quantifying compound toxicity. The plan is to calibrate the toolbox against known methods quantifying cell viability, applying known toxic agents and withdrawn drugs. This will constitute a stringent test for the efficiency of the proposed method at quantifying deleterious effects of a compound. Second, the goal is to optimize the algorithm to measure therapeutic potential, using positive controls on micropattern-based organoids modeling Huntington's Disease (HD). The objective is to demonstrate the ability to analyze results of a screening campaign aimed at phenotypic reversal on the HD organoids, and detect hit molecules from a small library of FDA-approved drugs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to create an abuse-free and ad-free social network based on principles of affirmative consent using a novel hybrid human-machine moderation technology. Harassment and abuse plague current social platforms. This abuse is particularly directed towards women, people of color, and the LGBTQ community, who are most vulnerable to these types of attacks. These demographics around the world need a harassment-free social network platform to communicate and share content and would be willing to pay a subscription fee. In addition, independent "new media" content creators also need an advertising-free and harassment-free platform to build an audience, interact with followers or fans, control access to paid content, and receive payment for their work. Users who have fled other platforms due to harassment, data mining, or personal privacy concerns may also want friendly and safe spaces to interact and share content. In addition to subscription fees, this novel moderation technology has the potential to be offered as a service to other social network businesses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research SBIR Phase I project takes a novel consent-based approach to social network moderation. The project combines data from multiple sources, including machine learning models, in order to give users more control over the content they wish to see and prevent harassment and abuse. By supplementing automated approaches with human ones, and putting users in control of which sources of moderation content and metadata to trust, this innovation will reduce the labor required for human moderation and the accuracy of machine approaches, all while making relatively strong guarantees that the most vulnerable users will not be exposed to abuse or harassment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop a microfluidic device for cell therapy manufacturing. Advantages in terms of cost and quality of the cell products produced by the proposed technology should benefit clinical researchers and cell therapeutics. Further, by providing an efficient, standardized, and scalable approach to the manufacturing process, the translation of lab-scale discoveries to curative therapies that are widely-available should be significantly accelerated.  On a fundamental level, this project will enhance technological understanding of how to apply microfluidic technology concepts to clinically-relevant applications (requiring macroscopic flowrates) in a practical manner, while also establishing a new medical device sector centered on a suite of easily implemented cell separation devices for use in cellular therapies and related fields.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to employ a cell separation approach to create a high-throughput proof-of-concept prototype to help simplify and streamline the manufacture of cellular therapies.  To accomplish this objective, a two-stage microfluidic module will be designed to achieve isolation of separate lymphocyte- and monocyte-rich subpopulations from blood samples, while removing undesirable red blood cells and platelets, at levels sufficient for successful culture growth.  In addition, the plan is to fabricate a full-scale prototype system of parallelized lymphocyte/monocyte isolation modules to achieve a volumetric throughput capable of processing 200mL of peripheral blood-, buffy coat-, or mononuclear cell (MNC) leukapheresis-derived product within ~30 minutes.  Once developed, this technology will overcome many drawbacks that plague current cell isolation approaches including high per unit cost, laborious/time-consuming workflow, and potential to compromise sterility. This device will require no expensive or complex equipment on-site to drive the separation/concentration of the cells of interest.

    This SBIR Phase I project examines the feasibility of using magnetic sensors based on Acoustically Driven Ferromagnetic Resonance (ADFMR) for neurological imaging. Information about brain activity is critical to the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of disorders including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. The most powerful non-invasive technique for measuring brain activity, magnetoencephalography (MEG), uses magnetometers that require liquid helium cooling and magnetic shielding to operate. Due to these requirements, current MEG systems are large and expensive, limiting their adoption and accessibility. ADFMR sensors could allow for the measurement of biomagnetic fields without the need for cryogenics and magnetic shielding, dramatically reducing the size, cost, and power consumption of such systems. The portability of this improved technology would allow for functional neuroimaging outside of the carefully controlled imaging suites where it is possible today. This could allow for diagnosis of previously unreachable patients (ie. in the ICU, operating room, or ambulance) as well as the development of new uses for this technology (ie. long-term monitoring, scanning during movement). This improved, portable MEG could also enable the first practical, portable brain-computer interface ? applicable across a wide variety of applications in both defense and consumer sectors.

    This SBIR Phase I project investigates the ability for ADFMR sensors to measure extremely small magnetic fields, such as those generated by the human brain. The ADFMR phenomenon has been shown to be a much more power and size efficient alternative to traditional methods of exciting ferromagnetic resonance, allowing for its use as a sensing mechanism for chip-scale magnetometers. In the proposed program, a number of methods to improve the performance of current ADFMR devices will be investigated. First, a compact model will be developed to allow for fast modeling of ADFMR devices and their associated detection circuitry. Using the results of this model, devices will be fabricated in order to experimentally validate various mechanisms for the reduction of 1/f noise in the detector circuitry and for the optimization of the ADFMR absorption profile for maximum sensitivity to applied magnetic fields. These sensor elements will initially be tested using standard benchtop characterization equipment. Following a benchtop demonstration, challenges in miniaturizing the full sensor system will be addressed by developing fully integrated magnetometer prototypes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses the injection molding industry which generates over $100 billion in revenue in the US alone. The proposed multivariate shrinkage sensor promises a leap forward from the current use of in-mold pressure/temperature sensors for indirect estimation of molded part dimensions and quality. Direct measurement of the shrinkage along with pressure and temperature in situ from the proposed sensor will enable improved process and quality control methods for injection molding which will eliminate the burden of frequent post-molding inspections and allow fully automated manufacturing. As a result, over 30 % of manufacturing cost and time will be saved while achieving 100% quality assurance even for the parts with tighter specifications. The proposed sensor will help heavily regulated industries such as medical devices and automobile manufacturing in achieving significant time reduction for process set-up and stabilization, and improvement in parts quality while meeting stringent regulatory requirements. Each percentage point improvement in productivity due to cycle time reductions, yield improvements, and related automation corresponds to cost savings of more than $1 billion per year in the United States alone while reducing the energy consumption and environmental waste related to molding, discarding, and recycling of defective plastic parts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a creative and original concept: a multivariate design for measuring shrinkage along with pressure and temperatures via a conventionally packaged device. Furthermore, knowledge and understanding are expected to be advanced in the development and validation of improved on-line models for estimating molded part shrinkage in real-time. Previous research did not have access to in-mold shrinkage data and so propagated faulty initial conditions throughout the shrinkage analysis. Due to the lack of direct observability and controllability of the molded part dimensions, most molders rely on the use of cavity pressure traces or part weight measurements as estimators of the part dimensions. However, there still is no technology or research available to monitor and predict the shrinkage on-line during production to improve, to optimize and to control parts quality and processing parameters without using expensive instrumentation. The outcome of this Phase I project will fill this gap and develop a fully functional multivariate shrinkage sensor which will enable measurement of molded product dimensions in situ prior to ejection from the mold.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop technology for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).  Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as one of the best tools to catalogue cell types and understand their function.  The key advantage of scRNA-seq is that it provides transcriptome-wide information about individual cells in heterogeneous samples while alternative methods either provide information about only a limited set of genes (e.g., flow cytometry, qPCR) or cannot provide single-cell resolution (bulk RNA-seq, microarrays).  However, current scRNA-seq approaches remain expensive, enable only limited sample multiplexing, and are not compatible with common sample storage conditions. This project will focus on the key technical challenges that are required to develop universally applicable scRNA-seq kits that meet customer needs. If successful, the end product will be a scRNA-seq kit that is ready for pilot testing with academic and pharmaceutical company customers. By reducing the cost and increasing sample size and sample multiplexing of scRNA-seq, the technology will improve the ability to understand multicellular systems and enhance workflows used in the pharmaceutical industry, such as drug screening and patient stratification.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR  Phase I project is to develop a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) method by using a combinatorial barcoding scheme that labels transcripts within fixed cells.  The proposed technology makes it possible to measure the transcriptional profiles of hundreds of thousands of individual cells in parallel. Unlike previous scRNA-seq technologies, the technology also enables high sample multiplexing (up to 96 samples/experiment), is compatible with stored samples, and fixes cells before dissociation, reducing the risk of perturbations to gene expression during cell handling. Most importantly, the method requires no complex instruments, which contributes to making the technology an order of magnitude less expensive than existing technologies. The objectives of this project are to dramatically improve the number of molecules detected per cell and to simplify the workflow for users. Modifications to assay chemistry will be tested to increase molecular detection, and time-consuming steps in the workflow will be altered to shorten the overall experimental time and reduce the probability of user error.

    This SBIR Phase I project is dedicated to building a scalable project-based learning education technology platform. The technology in this project is based on a chatbot that sustains ongoing, interdisciplinary conversations with each student. The platform is designed to provide middle school students with curriculum materials that expose them to authentic and engaging real-world problems that, over the course of weeks or months, come together to form a cohesive response to a project prompt. The goal of this project is to build and refine this new form of eLearning platform that has the potential to greatly improve engagement and learning outcomes, especially for low-income and minority students. This goal will be achieved by making the standards-aligned educational content meaningful and relevant to the interests of students and by catering the instructional materials to each individual student's skill level so they can move through the materials at their own pace towards mastery. To measure the impact of this technology on student outcomes, this project will involve state-of-the-art efficacy research in accordance with guidelines in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).


    This SBIR Phase I project is concerned with developing a forward-looking education platform built around a chatbot that sustains long term, goals-oriented conversations powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and based on a decision tree architecture. The highly-customized chatbot is designed to make project-based learning scalable by empowering students to choose and customize their own project theme from a set of options, and then providing conversational explanations and practice questions that illustrate how Common Core standards apply to the student?s project. This research undertaking will involve developing and training custom neural networks to interpret student responses and questions. It will also involve developing algorithms that correctly identify each student's level of reading comprehension and, independently, conceptual understanding. With an understanding of the student's level, another algorithm will be developed that selects the appropriate materials and resources at the student?s reading comprehension level. These algorithms will be refined through user testing and a preliminary study of the efficacy of this education intervention will be tested in a correlational study with statistical controls.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop technology using engineered bacteria
    to improve protein stability in two large markets: therapeutic proteins and industrial
    enzymes. Proteins used as therapeutics frequently have insufficient half-lives
    in human blood plasma, so that patients with chronic disease need to receive frequent
    dosings, often by painful injections. These burdensome dosing schedules result
    in high rates of patient noncompliance, with attendant poor responses and negative
    health outcomes. Therapeutic proteins with improved half-lives in blood plasma
    would permit relaxed dosing schedules, lowering costs of administration and improving
    outcomes by reducing noncompliance. This proposed technology focuses on improving
    the plasma half-life of a therapeutic for a chronic disease primarily affecting
    children that currently comprises a $4B global market. Similarly, industrial enzymes
    are frequently deployed in harsh environments that impair enzyme stability and
    activity. Endowing enzymes with improved resistance to destabilizing chemicals
    would enable their deployment in high-value environments that are currently prohibitive.
    The proposed technology will be used to stabilize an enzyme for application in
    a $730M segment of the personalized medicine market. If successful, this work
    would provide a platform for developing next-generation enzymes deployable in
    currently prohibitive environments. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase
    I project is to utilize a synthetic biology platform to create proteins with new
    amino acid building blocks that dramatically improve half-life and stability.
    Many proteins used as therapeutics or used as industrial enzymes are stabilized
    by disulfide bonds. These bonds break in the presence of chemicals called reducing
    agents that are found both in human blood plasma (destabilizing to therapeutics)
    and in solvents and buffers (destabilizing to industrial enzymes). Using a strain
    of engineered E. coli that can incorporate amino acids beyond the 20 standard
    amino acids into proteins, the goal is to replace disulfide-forming cysteine amino
    acids with selenocysteine amino acids that form bonds called diselenides. Diselenide-stabilized
    proteins maintain stability and activity in environments with reducing agents
    incompatible with disulfide-stabilized proteins. This project will produce a diselenide-stabilized
    protein therapeutic for a major disease class. Improvements to disulfide-stabilized
    therapeutics will be demonstrated by ELISA assays showing improved binding activity,
    and by cell-based assays showing improved therapeutic activity, after prolonged
    exposure to blood plasma. This project also will produce a diselenide-stabilized
    industrial enzyme to catalyze a critical reaction for personalized medicine. Performance
    improvements over disulfide-stabilized enzymes will be demonstrated by in vitro
    stability and activity assays in reducing conditions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring curative gene editing therapies using CRISPR to patients with genetic diseases. CRISPR-based therapeutics have the potential to be next generation therapeutics, particularly for genetic diseases due to their ability to cut DNA with sequence specificity. However, this type of targeted genome editing has not yet been successfully demonstrated for human therapeutics with existing methods.  The translation of CRISPR-based gene editing to the clinic remains a significant unmet need and the most difficult aspect of translating CRISPR-based gene editing into therapeutics is the lack of safe and effective delivery methods to the target the tissues. Existing viral-based delivery systems have limitations that include immunogenicity, pre-existing antibodies against them, broad tropism, off-target effects, restricted DNA cargo packaging capacity, and manufacturing challenges. As a result, non-viral methods that employ synthetic materials are being widely investigated as potential alternatives. Developing non-viral delivery vehicles that can effectively deliver CRISPR components to target tissues will improve the ability to broadly use CRISPR-based therapeutics for many genetic diseases.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a non-viral delivery system for the CRISPR enzyme Cas 12a (Cpf1) for delivery to target muscle tissue, and, potentially, enable the development of a novel gene editing treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The approach involves proprietary CRISPR-nanoparticles that are composed of peptide PEG-PAsp(DET) complexed to Cpf1 RNP, which possess good biocompatibility and high gene editing efficiency with the potential to manufacture and scale up under GMP for use in clinical trials. Preliminary data demonstrate that PEG-PAsp(DET) complexed to Cpf1 RNP can efficiently deliver Cpf1 RNP to the muscle tissue and can induce the expression of the dystrophin protein by deleting exon23 with a mutation. Under this proposal, the specific experiments will focus on improving the biocompatibility, stability, and muscle-targeting ability of the CRISPR-nanoparticles. The experimental plan is to synthesize various Peptide-PEG-PAsp(DET), followed by screening in primary myoblasts and reporter mouse system. This technology using CRISPR-nanoparticles will be the first example of a delivery vehicle that can simultaneously deliver Cpf1 protein and gRNA via intravenous injection and achieve gene editing.

    a novel vaccine technology to diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP)
    vaccine to produce a thermostable and orally administered formulation. Vaccines
    are one of the best investments in global public health and are estimated to save
    2-3 million lives per year and protect more than 100 million lives from illness
    and disability. This project proposes to use a novel vaccine technology platform
    that targets immune cells in the intestine, enducing a broad immune response,
    and retains stability at room temperature. This technology has the potential to
    minimize dependence on the cold-chain and trained medical professionals to administer
    the vaccine, which are barriers to full vaccine coverage. Additionally, it has
    potential to increase uptake of vaccine booster doses for adults, with convenience
    of self-administration and reduced anxiety with no needles. Finally, successful
    formulation of an oral DTaP vaccine would open the doors to other antigens to
    be delivered orally. This technology can significantly improve national health,
    which is one of the missions of NSF. Additionally, switching vaccines to thermostable,
    oral delivery form is very cost-effective and will alleviate the burden and cost
    of cold-chain and professional to administer the vaccines. \n\nThis SBIR Phase

    vaccine. The highly innovative delivery platform consists of a novel adjuvant,
    a C-type lectin (CTL) receptor ligand with aluminum hydroxide that targets mucosal
    immune cells for a strong synergistic boosting of broad immune response, and microencapsulation
    of the vaccine to resist the strong acidic environment of the stomach. This technology
    can be incorporated into existing or new vaccines enhancing stability and allowing
    oral delivery. The first goal of this project includes incorporation of CTL receptor
    ligand to the DTaP vaccine and applying enteric microencapsulation to the particles
    to protect the vaccine from low pH. Extensive testing and experiments will be
    conducted to obtain the optimal formulation of the final oral vaccine. The second
    goal will be to test and compare the potency of the newly formulated vaccine with
    a commercially available DTaP vaccine in mice. The final goal will be to test
    and compare the stability of both vaccines at high temperatures. Successful completion
    of all objectives will provide a great base for commercial feasibility of the
    technology. This technology has the potential to be incorporated on any vaccine
    that can benefit from a thermostable and orally delivery platform.\n\nThis award
    reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel seed treatment technology
    for plants, based on small naturally occurring molecules proven to activate natural
    defenses against a wide range of agriculturally important pathogens. The proposed
    innovation as a plant protectant is active at very low concentrations (nM range),
    can be readily synthesized in large quantities, and is biodegradable and non-toxic.
    To feed a projected world population of over 9 billion people in 2050, innovation
    will be required at all stages of crop production and distribution. Annual application
    of more than 600 different chemical pesticides (500 million Kg) costs $10 billion,
    and yet 37% of all crops are still destroyed by pests (insects 13%, pathogens
    12%, weeds 12%). By providing an alternative, effective method for managing transmissible
    diseases in major crops, dependence on existing agrochemicals such as copper,
    synthetic fungicides and antibiotics will be reduced, as will the rate of resistance
    development. The goal is to improve the economic and environmental sustainability
    of agriculture by reducing the use of potentially harmful pesticides, and significantly
    enhance food security worldwide. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR project
    is to develop a novel control for plant pathogens by leveraging a class of small,
    naturally occurring molecules that elicit specific immune responses in plants.
    These small molecules are recognized by plants at extremely low concentrations,
    and their perception has been demonstrated to result in defense responses and
    enhanced resistance to viral, bacterial, oomycete, and fungal pathogens, in Arabidopsis,
    tomato, potato, barley, and wheat. In order to bring the innovation to market
    in the form of a commercial seed treatment, the following must be demonstrated:
    a seed-coating formulation capable of long-term stability and efficacy, without
    adverse effect on seed germination or natural microbe/insect populations. The
    focus of the proposed Phase I project will be to optimize synthesis of the compound
    of interest and develop a stable, commercially viable formulation that is effective
    across a breadth of crops. Following initial validation, product testing will
    advance to in vivo efficacy testing in greenhouse and field trials. The seed treatment
    product developed will establish the technical and economic feasibility of using
    small-molecule signals to activate plant immune responses, and demonstrate their
    utility to improve economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase I project will produce a digital + physical game for 6-10 year olds that fosters computational thinking practices through collaboration, listening, and tinkering through play with music. It is widely recognized that to be ready for the future, today?s students need to develop the ability to think critically, identify and solve complex problems, communicate clearly about their thinking, and work collaboratively with a team. Computational thinking (CT) is the core of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and is about developing a set of problem-solving heuristics, approaches and habits of mind. Collaboration and creativity, now seen as cross-cutting 21st Century skills, are also viewed as CT practices. Not all learners are motivated to learn CT through traditional programming contexts, even those designed for young learners. Moreover, there are a lack of learning environments to engage children in tinkering--trying things out and debugging--finding out why things didn?t happen as expected. And, the vast majority of existing CT learning environments for young children do not explicitly support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and collaborating with others to achieve a goal. This product will enhance students? grasp of collaborative problem solving and ultimately computational thinking by engaging them in fundamental concepts that unite computing and music.


    The core technical innovation of this project is the design and development methodology that will lead to the creation of a transformative learning platform in its approach to learning outcomes, collaborative problem solving, and engaging game play. This multi-user, multi-device experience relies on a new approach to collaborative problem solving, leveraging multiple user inputs responsive to group tinkering and debugging. Players must employ critical listening, tinkering, debugging, and communication to identify pieces of music that are off, and work collaboratively to adjust controllers to get the music back to its original state. This game not only requires problem solving across scales (debugging smaller parts of the puzzle to get to an overall solution) but also requires collaboration and communication, something largely missing in educational games for children. This phase will focus on the build of the digital component of the game as well as conduct research and development around physical controllers. Additionally, this phase of development will research the balance of visual, audio and haptic feedback mechanisms to help players through frustrating moments, foster player communication and collaboration, and test visual design for the most effective feedback.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop educational technologies to better train university students to innovate. To become innovators, students must gain practice solving real-world problems, such as reducing hospital acquired infections, narrowing education achievement gaps or reducing poverty. However, universities struggle to provide the labor intensive, face-to-face coaching necessary for student innovators to tackle real-world problems. This project develops a novel online project-based learning platform that helps instructors more effectively coach innovation project teams. The platform allows instructors to (a) create libraries of project goals to help students plan, (b) collaboratively author and remix design guides to help students develop technical skills, and (c) crowdsource large group, face-to-face critique to provide feedback on in-progress innovation work. The research and development in this project focus on overcoming the technical risks associated with creating the software libraries necessary to create new project-based learning platforms and supporting the complex computer-supported collaborative learning interactions necessary to achieve desired learning outcomes. By developing the technologies necessary to enable more effective project-based learning, this project will improve university education and create a more capable innovation workforce better able to tackle societal challenges.


    This SBIR Phase I project will conduct research and development of the Loft platform, which combines a novel project-based learning environment, social media platform, and software components to transform how universities train social innovators. Technical risks in this project stem from software engineering, learning sciences, and computer-supported cooperative work obstacles associated with creating novel software platforms to enable new pedagogical strategies that achieve more effective learning outcomes in project-based learning environments. Software libraries will include a more powerful and flexible set of components for creating complex object hierarchies and social media interfaces required for rapid development of the crowdsourcing and real-time collaborative editing features needed for online project-based learning platforms. The platform will introduce new computer-supported collaborative learning strategies, such as collaborative remixing of instructional content, technology-supported tailoring of instructional goals to individual project teams, and crowd critique to provide feedback as good or better than individual instructors. Research and development will test the impact of the platform on learning outcomes for innovation teams.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to drive economic growth and innovation by increasing a knowledge worker's ease of access to the digital information that is relevant to his/her work. Businesses today are enormously dependent on the archives of files, communication, and other information contained within the systems and services they rely on (networked drives, cloud storage, messaging tools, email, etc.). As these archives grow, they are increasingly hard to standardize and organize so that individuals know where to look for and how to find the information they need to do their jobs. The result is that individual employees waste enormous amounts of time trying to locate files and information fragmented across complex directories and many communication channels. Centralizing access to files and communication within an easily searchable and flexible workspace can unlock several hours of lost productivity and duplicate efforts per knowledge worker per week. Furthermore, presenting all of the relevant context around each file and message, including other file-versions, related files, discussions, activity events, etc., can help knowledge workers today with better version control, an understanding of how projects/ideas unfold, transferring of best practices, and preventing institutional knowledge-loss.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to further develop a novel method for users to contextually and unobtrusively access all relevant files and information associated with their work. This project focuses on developing software that can automatically map the relationships between digital workflow components (email messages, chat messages, tasks, contacts, files, etc.), and store them in discrete private databases controlled by the users. This project's key technical challenges include: improving the proprietary algorithms that automatically interconnect user information (while the information remains hosted on third party systems/services); improving the scalability of data ingress, processing, indexing, and syncing; and establishing a system capable of hosting and processing a multitude of discrete and disconnected databases of user information. The anticipated outcome of this project is a new type of software platform that can be hosted in private instances and that improves the productivity of its users by: consolidating user information stored on third-party systems/services; making it all easily searchable and manageable; and augmenting every file with additional history and context from all other connected third party systems/services.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes the creation of a unique, art-centric e-learning platform aimed at sparking the interest of young learners in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This extensible software platform implements a new category of e-learning based on the ample body of research in educational psychology and technology that advocates the use of art and guided play to teach STEM. This project will test the hypothesis that an e-learning system based on scientific illustration sparks engagement and enhances learning in young students. With students disengaging from STEM at an increasing rate, it is critical to make more tools available to teachers that connect student with STEM. STEM-related fields will drive innovation in our economy for decades to come; opening new pathways to vastly broaden participation in STEM is critical to our economic future. This project also proposes the creation of an online community and marketplace supporting STEM education through this platform. This will connect teacher-to-teacher for sharing best practices in teaching science using art and can make a deep and broad impact on the way STEM is taught.


    Built on scientific illustration and coupled with a set of tangible user interface (TUI) devices that mimic scientific instruments, this e-learning platform brings student hand-drawn art to life, creating interactive lessons that correlate to Next Generation Science Standards. As this system will be extensible and customizable, a major part of the R&D effort will be to create an easy-to-use templating toolkit that any teacher can leverage to develop custom lessons in STEM. The Phase I goal will be to create a fully functioning product and assess this system in elementary school classrooms. This toolkit will be developed in collaboration with Curio Interactive?s educational partners, as well as the Pacific Science Center, where Curio Interactive is a startup in residence, to rapidly develop this system, continuously iterating the software with real testers, following agile development methods. One of this project?s objectives is to appeal to groups historically underrepresented in STEM. Because this platform will be visual and kinetic, highly affordable, and universally available via the web, the proposed platform will improve the equity and accessibility of learning science.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will provide prototype products to satisfy
    customer needs in prioritized wearable sensor market segments for the endurance
    sports market. One advantage of the proposed sensor is its similar feel to cloth
    fabric, a benefit in comfort and convenience to the user.  This is in contrast
    to current hydration monitors made of thick plastic materials requiring the use
    of an additional wristband or adhesive patch.  This value proposition was developed
    and tested based on the findings of 374 customer interviews during a spring 2017
    NSF I-Corps workshop.  That study determined the commercial and product potential
    of a fabric sensor to monitor hydration.  In 2015 alone more than 17.1 million
    people finished endurance events.  According to interview data, 50% of respondents
    are interested in a hydration solution due to past dehydration and cramping issues.
    Additionally, 40% of respondents indicated interest in a technology-based solution.
    This group equates a target market of $342 million for a hydration monitor priced
    at $100 per unit, a good estimation of the total available market based on I-Corps
    interviews. In general, the data collected from the developed sensor could lead
    to better understanding of health and disease processes, including the analysis
    of common diabetic neurological complications, the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
    (CF), and sweat monitoring for advanced prosthetic limb applications, bedridden
    patients, or athlete performance tracking leading to better treatments and health
    outcomes for all patients.  \n\nA monitor that analyzes the sodium concentration
    of a person's sweat would be able to notify them before they begin suffering from
    exercise-induced illnesses such as hypernatremia or hyponatermia. This early notification
    system would allow people to be on top of their hydration, and be able to replenish
    their electrolytes as needed, without overhydrating. The team has developed flexible,
    lightweight fabric materials that can selectively determine physiological information
    from sweat forming on the surface of the skin.  The technology is the first lightweight
    fabric sensor to provide real-time information regarding hydration levels during
    exercise or training. These dehydration patterns are unique and vary based on
    diet, weather conditions, and human physiological cycles. The ability to monitor
    an individual's hydration parameters is unique to the proposed sensor and gives
    it a competitive advantage over sweat monitors that monitor water lost or water
    timers that remind the athlete to drink water every 20 minutes.  Specifically,
    the proposed work will focus on the large-scale development of a hydration monitor,
    validation of the monitor during material testing and on the body in an exercise
    physiology laboratory, and leveraging partnerships with potential strategic partners.
    As athletes strive for peak performance, improper hydration can undermine their
    progress in both training and competitive settings.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    Research (SBIR) project is  the development of an improved methane sensor module
    that can enables new drone sensing and sensor network applications in the energy,
    agricultural, and waste management sectors. Methane, the third largest energy
    source after petroleum and coal in the U.S., is relatively difficult and expensive
    to measure compared to other gasses. It is a major atmospheric pollutant, both
    as a component of smog and as a greenhouse gas. This technology can provide societal
    environmental benefits by helping reduce methane release into the environment
    through the ubiquitous sensing of small natural gas leaks, allowing companies
    to rapidly respond. This sensor system has the sensitivity of laser-based spectrometers
    but is smaller, lighter, and has lower power requirements at a price three orders
    of magnitude less than existing high-end spectrometers. Designed to reduce power,
    weight and cost to a minimum while not compromising sensitivity, this technology
    is ideal for UAV-based measurements. It can also give station mounted and handheld
    monitoring units high sensitivity at a lower price point, enabling multiple monitor
    sampling strategies and a multi-station networked array to track intermittent
    sources of methane leaks. This technology can provide novel capabilities to cost-conscious
    customers in the energy sector while opening up additional markets for agricultural,
    waste management, and safety products. A first prototype of this methane sensor
    successfully measured methane in nitrogen down to 10 ppm. The long-term objective
    is the creation of a commercially available low-cost, high precision methane sensor
    product line. SBIR project funding is enabling the transition of this promising
    sensor technology from a small business research and development project into
    the early commercialization stages of a valuable new product. \n\n\nThis SBIR
    Phase 1 project proposes to create a self-contained methane sensor system, smaller
    in size than a quarter, with the sensitivity of advanced laser spectrometers.
    Current methods of detection do not meet the needs of industry. They are either
    cheap, high power and low sensitivity, such as catalyst-based systems, or they
    are large, expensive, high power optical systems. There is a market need for methane
    sensors that improve upon size, weight and power, while still maintaining useful
    sensitivity and selectivity. The system consists of 3 primary modules: the replaceable
    or consumable sensor package, the sense electronics, and the data storage and
    communication system. Due to the extremely low power requirements of the sensor,
    clever design of the data and communications system is critical if the low power
    benefits of the sensor are to be realized in a product. Ultimately, the system
    will include wireless connectivity (Bluetooth, WiFi, 5G, Zigbee) for cloud and
    IoT data management. This design will be prototyped and will undergo performance
    measurements. Materials for methane sensing will be identified  The objective
    of SBIR Phase 1 is to produce an initial prototype sensor for methane-sensing
    that will be the focus of SBIR Phase II.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance novel techniques for developing high-resolution noninvasive brain imaging systems, capable of recording unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution inferences of the brain activity for a portable system.  These systems leverage novel fundamental analysis and results, and experimental demonstrations, that show that spatial resolution of Electroencephalography (EEG) is not saturated at densities of a few hundred electrodes, unlike what has been widely believed in clinical and neuroscience community.  They also build on recent work by the PIs that enables faster and reliable acquisition of EEG signals. The success of the proposed work will help diagnose worsening brain injuries before the injury occurs. Brain injuries affect 1.7 million Americans every year. Commercially, it will enable higher resolution brain-machine interfaces for applications such as virtual reality interfacing and neuroprostheses, generating novel avenues for jobs and revenue through creation of an entirely new industry.  This transdisciplinary effort brings together neuroscientists and engineers and the concepts developed in this effort will inform material for basic neuroscience and neuroengineering courses.  The team will continue to publish and publicize their work at clinical conferences.  One of the core employees will be a minority female who has contributed to the research, guided several other minority (and non-minority) female students, and now wants to lead the development end of this project.

    This effort builds a systematic platform that challenges the widely held belief that increasing electrode-densities of EEG to beyond a few hundred electrodes does not improve spatial resolution. There are several problems with the traditional EEG that the platform overcomes: (i) typically only 9-32 electrodes are used for clinical diagnoses and these are fundamentally limited to only providing poor spatial resolution; (ii) because traditional EEGs have low resolution, surgical treatments often require invasive procedures. E.g., for diagnosing severity or worsening of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) by measuring parameters of cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), which are mediators of worsening brain injuries; (iii) long-term EEG measurements are cumbersome, and high-density systems can take hours of manual labor to install. The PIs' preliminary work provides strong evidence supporting the claim that ultra-high-density EEG will provide the first non-invasive and portable modality for high spatial and temporal resolution brain imaging.  Novel brain-imaging algorithms will be developed and benchmarked against existing techniques and assessed using novel fundamental limits.  Novel techniques will be deployed in the design of conductive sponges and in lowering power, enabling the platform to be portable and usable over long term.  These improvements will be rigorously tested through simulations, experiments, and real data analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a low cost Lidar+Thermal camera to the autonomous car market that will eventually enable level 4 and level 5 autonomy. The proposed innovation incorporates both a Lidar and a thermal detector to locate objects but also classify them, as this is the most crucial aspect of autonomous vehicles. The dual polarity Lidar+Thermal photodetector solves a few major issues in the current Lidar industry. First, current Lidars have to use advanced algorithms to classify the objects, whereas a Lidar+Thermal detector can easily distinguish between animate and inanimate objects, while continuing to establish their location. This is done due to the drastic heat signature of animate objects. Second, the dual polarity detector is able to detect and locate hazards on the road such as snow or puddles, which is vital if autonomous vehicles are used in northern regions. In addition, the frame rate of the Flash Lidar+Thermal is up to 200 Frames per second, which will drastically reduce smearing effects and allow for driving at speeds of 70+ MPH. Lastly, the high thermal resolution of the camera will ensure operation in bad weather conditions including fog and rain.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide a proof-of-concept of the dual polarity Lidar+Thermal detector. An array of 32x32 pixels will demonstrate that in one polarity, a thermal hot-mid-wave image and in the other polarity the pixels will operate in a time-of-flight mode for Flash Lidar operation. The pixel?s spectral response will range from 500nm up to 3.5?m in the Lidar mode. Characterization of the detector array will use the eye-safe 1550nm laser. The goal is to show a 200m Lidar operation with a high resolution of a few centimeters and thermal imaging with a thermal sensitivity of 4mK. The transition to Phase II will include an array size of 1000x500 with 10?m pixel pitch. The detector will be evaluated outdoors to demonstrate the detection of animate objects, snow and puddles and will be tested under fog conditions.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable a much wider adoption of various photomedical treatments.  Broadly speaking, photomedical treatments use light to cure diseases and promote healing.  Specifically, photodynamic therapy uses light to activate a photosensitizing chemical agent to kill cancer cells or bacterial with minimal side effects.  Moreover, photobiomodulation is the application of light to impaired or dysfunctional tissue to reduce pain and inflammation to speed healing and to promote or inhibit various cellular processes.  The light source is a critical part of any photomedical treatment system.  Existing sources such as lasers and LED arrays are bulky and expensive, generally require additional optics to deliver the light to the target treatment areas.  The current project aims to develop a photomedical treatment system based on a novel light source - quantum dot light emitting devices (QLEDs).  Flexible and large area QLEDs can be placed immediately adjacent to target treatment areas without additional optics.  Their simple driver requirements will result in much lower system costs and facilitate at-home use.  These QLED-based systems will enable the wider adoption of photomedical treatment methodologies, including in currently underserved areas and patient populations.

    The proposed project will leverage the recent invention of ultra-bright quantum dot light emitting devices (QLEDs) into a low-cost and convenient-to-use photomedical treatment system that will enable wider adoption of photomedical treatment methodologies for a variety of pathologies and use cases.  Project tasks include developing QLEDs with emitting spectra precisely tuned to match the absorption spectra of photosensitizers at 630 nanometers (nm), 635 nm and 660 nm; fabricating QLEDs on flexible substrates with device structures guided by microcavity simulations; developing a low DC voltage, current-controlled driver able to deliver a precise light dosage; and demonstrating the photomedical efficacy of thus developed QLEDs in a) ALA-PplX photodynamic therapy and associated dosimetry of oral malignancies using in-vitro 3D co-culture models of oral cancers; b) determining and optimizing parameters for photobiomodulation for wound healing applications including incisional and pressure ulcer wounds, in-vitro using multiple cell lines and models of cellular metabolism, cellular proliferation and scratch wound healing.  Successful completion of these tasks will result in a functional preliminary photomedical treatment system that lays the foundation for in-vivo animal studies of oral cancer or diabetic wound healing treatment paradigms in Phase II of the project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make walking both safer and easier for transfemoral amputees. Falling and fear of falling are pervasive in this population. Transfemoral amputees fall at a rate approximately 200 times that of healthy age-matched individuals, and they seek medical attention from falls at the same rate as the institution-living elderly. Such falls result most commonly from a lack of full knee extension in late swing, combined with a lack of knee proprioception, in which case the user enters a non-recoverable knee buckling state shortly after loading. This project proposes a knee prosthesis that provides a powered, motion-controlled knee swing which guarantees full knee extension prior to heel strike, and it therefore substantially reduces the likelihood of a fall. Further, powered knee movement lessens the need for compensatory movements, and therefore the effort required for walking is lessened. As a result, the proposed knee will provide safer and easier walking, enabling users to walk with greater confidence. The prosthesis will be reimbursable under current reimbursement codes and will result in improved mobility, health, and quality of life for end users.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project proposes a novel knee prosthesis that incorporates a hybrid approach to providing the two major functions of a knee prosthesis: stance and swing control. In this device, stance control is provided by a polycentric joint, while swing control utilizes a small motor for assistance. Consequently, the proposed device is called a polycentric swing-assist (PSA) knee. Unlike a passive extension aid employed in a typical polycentric knee, the swing-assist motor is able to aid both flexion in mid swing and extension in late swing. The PSA prosthesis is intended to inject small amounts of power during the swing phase of gait in order to guide the knee through the swing trajectory. Since the assistance is associated with low-torque and low-power movements, the motor, transmission, and battery can be small, lightweight, and quiet relative to a fully-powered knee prosthesis. The goal of this work is to design, construct, and test a PSA knee prototype. The efficacy of the prosthesis prototype will be compared to a commercial knee. The investigators will test whether or not the prosthesis better emulates healthy kinematics through outcome measures such as toe clearance and peak knee flexion across walking speeds.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to help wastewater treatment plants become compliant
    with emerging environmental regulations, while saving energy and without adding
    cost.  It has potential to reduce the amount of biosolids that need to be shipped
    off-site and landfilled by up to 85% as well as completely destroy odors and pathogens.
    \ As a result, the project may also enhance social justice throughout the country.
    \ Currently, low-income and disadvantaged communities inherit waste from other
    communities, sometimes very far away from where the waste originated.  They inherit
    the stench, the vectors (rats, flies, birds) and toxins.  For example, 7% of the
    biosolids produced by New York City end up in Alabama, via trains and trucks.
    \ People living near the landfills and along transportation routes no longer use
    their porch because of the stench.  By improving the economics of a technology
    that destroys organics much better than state-of-the-art technologies, wastewater
    treatment plants will become cleaner, less malodorous and use less energy.  Other
    markets could open as well including clean power and chemical manufacturing. Finally,
    the project may lead to increased hiring of employees over the next three years.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an affordable and reliable process
    to cleanly and completely destroy organic waste, extract more resources and energy
    from sludge and biosolids at wastewater treatment plants while considerably reducing
    the amount of biosolids that need to be shipped off-site for disposal.  This objective
    will be achieved by improving a process that uses water contained within the waste
    to create a hyper oxidative environment.  Similar processes use costly and hazardous
    pure oxygen, are extremely energy intensive, and are plagued with high maintenance
    cost.  By making innovations in energy recovery, the use of air as an oxidant
    instead of oxygen is possible without the large cost associated with having to
    heat and compress an entire air stream- oxygen plus inert nitrogen. Once optimal
    technical conditions for energy recovery are identified, the project will enter
    the design and fabrication phases. The resulting new energy recovery module will
    be added to an existing system. The prototype will be tested for continuous operation.
    New insights into energy recovery will be gained, which will benefit the scientific
    community as a whole.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project centers on the possibility opened by plasma-activated water in dairy sanitation. Plasma activated water has several advantages: it is reusable and reduces the need to buy, store, and dispose of chemicals, it will not face antimicrobial resistance, unlike chemicals, and could be a faster disinfectant. In addition to replacing chemical disinfectants, plasma activated water could prove to be fast enough to allow for disinfecting the milking unit in-between individual cows, which should reduce the spread of mastitis within a herd, reducing the farmer's costs in terms of medicine, increased labor, and culling. By using plasma activated water as part of a milking system, cleaning could be automated as well as target spores in farm environments. The resulting reduction in costs, infection rate, manual labor & strain, and increase in milk quality, could revolutionize the dairy industry.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to research a method whereby plasma activated water replaces chemical disinfectants used in dairy milking machines. The dairy industry is facing two major problems relating to milking machines: first, a manual labor shortage, and secondly an ever-present threat of mastitis, an infection estimated to cost the industry $1B annually. These two problems come to a head at the milking machine, as current methods require cows to be manually cleaned before milking. The goal of this project is to explore whether plasma activated water could be an effective replacement for teat dips, aiming to design a self-cleaning milking attachment for existing machines, and clean the cows with PAW prior to milking. In Phase I, the focus will be on building a basic prototype to check sanitation capabilities, and compatibility with a farm environment. Future research would include a longer-term study of animals and track infection rates before and after.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will be the research and development of a new class of extremely portable deployable structures that allows easier transportation and simplifies the deployment of bulky structure. This fundamental technology covers a wide variety of potential commercial products including large easily transported rescue equipment and large tents for earthquake and other widespread humanitarian disaster scenarios; large space satellite structures such as antennas and optical arrays; large deployable UAV wings; large volumes for habitation or material storage; piping for water, sewage, oil or gas. This technology can help save lives during disasters, ease the transportation of potable water, sewer and energy with lower construction and deployment costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase I project will entail the systematic analysis and development of a novel highly compact, rapidly deployable composite tube technology. The challenge is to harness and combine the extremely energy dense properties of chemical combustion with a photocuring high-performance structural composite material to create an easily transported structure that can be rapidly deployed.  The project will entail experiments to better understand the polymer material properties and tailor them to the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the combustion. Customization of an adhesive that will combine the necessary viscosity, structural and curing properties. A multiphysics simulation, validated with laboratory experiments, will be used to predict the technology's limitations.  The qualifying components will be utilized in a refined design and evaluated by manufacturers for large scale production. These efforts will culminate in scale prototype construction and testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop disease resistant soybean varieties that will reduce the substantial losses in agricultural production caused by plant diseases.  Loss to disease can be as high as 40% globally and cost billions of dollars annually. In soybean alone, an estimated $3 billion dollars of production value is lost from plant diseases annually.  In addition, the destruction of crops by plant diseases threatens global food security and has a significant negative impact on the environment due to the use of pesticides. Application of a tunable, broad-spectrum disease resistance strategy in agriculturally important crops will have a major societal impact by protecting crops from devastating diseases for which alternative solutions are not currently available, securing agricultural production, and reducing environmental pollution from agricultural chemicals.  In the future, the goal is to apply the proposed technology to other agriculturally important crops such as corn, rice, and tomato.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to engineer tunable, broad-spectrum disease resistant soybean varieties. In this project, a soybean immune regulatory cassette will be constructed through sequence homology, and then functionally validated by demonstrating pathogen-inducible resistance against various diseases with minimal yield penalty. The methods that will be used in this project include bioinformatic analysis of soybean sequences to identify homologous defense genes and corresponding regulatory elements, molecular cloning, transformation of both Arabidopsis and Soybean plants, and testing the resulting transformant plants to determine levels of resistance to different types of pathogens. Results from this project will be essential for moving forward with larger field trials, which to be accomplished in the Phase II of the project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to significantly lower the cost and expand the number of addressable markets for ice thermal energy storage. Cost effectively storing energy is imperative to a sustainable future. Storage can provide reliable access to power from intermittent renewable sources, increase the resiliency of the grid to weather events or terrorist attacks, and increase the utilization efficiency of existing assets, deferring costly upgrades. Today, ice thermal storage systems help building owners shift cooling loads from costly peak hours to when electricity is less expensive. Unfortunately the upfront cost of these systems, driven by the large cost of the cooling coil used to generate ice, prevents adoption from many users and has unduly restricted the number of addressable markets for ice thermal storage. Elimination of ice buildup on the cooling coil would reduce the size of the coil, and more importantly significantly lower the cost of these systems. Low-cost ice thermal energy storage could greatly improve the economics for long-duration energy storage technologies such as pumped thermal energy storage.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to translate the discovery of surfaces with zero ice adhesion into a cooling coil that can be integrated into a functioning ice thermal energy storage system. In order to repel ice, these surfaces require complete submersion in an immiscible oil phase, making coil geometry and overall system development challenging. At the beginning of this project, various plate and tube based cooling coil geometries will be systematically prototyped and refined, measuring the freezing and melting heat transfer efficiencies. Different formulations of the surface coating will be tested as well. The most promising candidate geometries will be charged and discharged over multiple cycles as part of an ice thermal energy storage system. The results from cycling will be compared to conventional ice-on-coil technology using metrics such as energy density and heat transfer efficiency. An ice shedding cooling coil, at less than a third of the size of an ice-on-coil system, is expected to deliver improved cooling performance. Demonstration of an ice shedding cooling coil in a functioning ice thermal energy storage system will prove the technology?s readiness to scale.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an innovative imaging device that applies tactile sensing to the surface detection of vertebrae to help clinicians place needles for the nearly 13 million diagnostic and therapeutic spinal punctures performed in the United States each year. The standard of care involves manual palpation of the back to estimate a vertebral gap for needle insertion. This technique is highly inaccurate, often requiring multiple attempts, which lead to pain and complications, unpredictable procedure times, poor throughput, and high rates of referrals to radiology for fluoroscopic guidance. By offering an accurate means of localizing bony landmarks, this project will enable successful insertion in fewer attempts, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing costs across the $3.2 million market, including emergency medicine, neurology, anesthesiology, and pain medicine. The device can also be introduced for training and to reduce errors in clinical testing of intrathecal drugs; and can increase procedure access by offering an alternative, bedside solution for challenging cases. To date, tactile imaging has only been applied clinically to soft-tissue evaluations. This project will pave the way for expanded use of this low-cost, non-radiative modality; to possibly replace palpation for other procedures, such as joint injections and thoracenteses.

    The innovation is the first standalone, clinical tactile imager. Its imaging subsystem comprises a sensitive, high-resolution pressure-sensing array, which detects vertebral landmarks when pressed against the back, and communicates them as a 2D pressure map to an integrated display. The device also includes a novel needle guide, which allows for flexible and reliable insertion. Positive gap localization has been verified in early development. This project will first confirm accurate insertion relative to imaging output by characterizing the relationship between guide and visualized-landmark locations, and by developing a mechanism to stabilize the device over unpredictable lumbar curvatures. Next, 2D pressure information will be evolved into an optimally robust and intuitive image. Advanced algorithms will be developed to detect, track, and highlight features of interest; and to understand and predict device use across cases. At each stage, the device will be tested on phantoms and through IRB testing on anesthesiology patients. Performance will be evaluated across anatomical variations, and compared with the standard of care. The resulting device will have demonstrated feasibility as a comprehensive spinal-puncture localization and insertion solution, rendering it suitable for further development and testing toward a regulatory submission, and providing compelling evidence for continued optimization in Phase II.

    The broader market impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to foster the mainstream use of decentralized database solutions in place of centrally owned and operated data centers and cloud services offered by companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. Data security breaches involving tens or hundreds of millions of customers are now commonplace, as are high-profile news stories related to questionable uses of customer-supplied data.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to solve the key problem of developing a new network protocol that allows for a low-latency, secure, persistent and highly-available, decentralized No-SQL database which may operate at Internet scale. Key objectives include: development of a novel P2P overlay network which combines a zero-hop Distributed Hash Table (DHT) as a base routing layer and any number of traditional Kademlia DHTs as application specific leaf networks, all of which may communicate through a variety of transport protocols; constructing a new proof-of-space for use  both as the consensus layer of a proof-of-space blockchain and as a proof-of-capacity for storage nodes; creating a secure Decentralized Storage Network utilizing a proof of replication based on verifiable delay functions; and implementing and testing the protocol across common host devices and client runtimes. The end goal of the project is to validate the technical feasibility, scalability, and market interest for the subspace protocol.

    Transfer (STTR) project will be a low-cost, high-performance nanofiltration membrane
    technology for removing oils, pollutants, and organic materials from highly contaminated

    manufacturing techniques such as high-precision spray coating with a novel chemistry
    platform based on zwitterionic copolymers to produce high-performance, low-cost

    layers of this thickness are only achievable using in-situ polymerization of nylon-based
    polymers, which are costly, have low permeability, and are intolerant of oxidizing

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to place the power of genetic identification in the hands of those who need it, at the front lines of conservation. The DNA Barcode Scanner will enable anyone, anywhere, to perform a low-cost, rapid, automated DNA test to validate the identity of a tissue sample, without specialized training, expensive lab-based equipment, reagents, or reliable power, where it is needed most - in the field. This technological advance has the potential to revolutionize species identification to prevent species extinction, to protect consumers and our food supply, and to combat threats to global biodiversity. The innovation's commercial potential includes improving the safety and sustainability of our supply chains, combatting costly environmental fraud, and detecting pests and pathogens that threaten our nation's economy, security, and health. The initial market opportunity is to address unmet demand from seafood suppliers, distributors, and retailers; government regulators and enforcement agents; and conservation and natural resources entities, for increased transparency and integrity of seafood supply chains by ending seafood mislabeling and fraud, which occurs in over 30% the $17.1 billion dollar U.S. seafood market and is worth up to $250,000 per illegal import.

    The proposed project will develop the customizable DNA collection, extraction, and amplification cartridge that enables a user to go from tissue sample to species identification in a single device. This project focuses on the scientific and technical challenge of automating sample preparation. The company's goal is to create an integrated device that will validate seafood products (our first market) from sample collection to DNA extraction, DNA amplification, and, ultimately, species identification. The goals of this project are to 1) determine a reliable and intuitive method for collecting DNA from a seafood product and create a prototype collection tool, 2) prototype an easy-to-use and highly flexible DNA extraction and sample preparation component to provide DNA suitable for analysis, and 3) fully integrate microfluidic processes and molecular chemistry (DNA amplification and analysis) with clear validation of multiple species. They will design and test several prototypes of the collection, extraction, and amplification cartridge and test these with users to identify the most robust and simplest method for delivering confident species identification. Their objective is to deliver a fully functional prototype that is intuitive for users and can perform a seafood species validation test in multiple field environments.

    This STTR Phase I project aims to pioneer a novel approach for the sustained delivery of peptide therapeutics using nano-composite microparticles. Peptide therapeutics tend to suffer from rapid enzymatic degradation and clearance, with half-lives on the order of minutes, and require frequent injections. The goal of a sustained release formulation is to reduce the frequency of injections by slowly releasing the therapeutic over a period of weeks to months. This will result in improved patient compliance and quality of life. Patient non-compliance is an economic burden that is estimated to cost the healthcare system over $100 billion/year. The lack of commercial success of existing sustained release technologies is due to low loading efficiencies, lack of controlled release at higher loading, and complex manufacturing. These limitations can be overcome with the newly-developed inverse Flash NanoPrecipitation (iFNP) process to produce nano-composite microparticles. This project aims to develop and test a once-monthly injectable formulation of a peptide therapeutic for type 2 diabetes that is currently injected daily. This research will aid in the understanding of the fundamental materials science and engineering principles that control therapeutic release from nano-composite microparticles. The rules for controlling release will apply broadly to other peptides, and this research will help to more rapidly develop future long-acting formulations.

    Current methods to produce peptide-loaded microparticles suffer from low drug loadings and poor encapsulation efficiencies, two of the most important factors for commercial viability. In contrast to existing methods, the iFNP technology allows for the assembly of nanoparticles with peptide loadings greater than 50wt% and encapsulation efficiencies greater than 90% in a fully scalable process. The nanoparticles are then assembled into microparticles to create the final sustained release formulation. Each drug-containing pore inside the microparticle is surrounded by a dense hydrophobic polymer layer which allows for therapeutic loadings 10x higher than competing technologies. The iFNP process has been demonstrated on a number of proof-of-concept molecules. In this project, iFNP will be used to produce a formulation of a peptide for diabetes therapy with a month-long release profile. The first goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the physical parameters that control the peptide stability and release. Supporting this goal, the peptide will be formulated with polymers of varying glass transition temperatures and degradation rates, and the release profiles will be measured in vitro. The efficacy of the optimal in vitro formulation will then be tested in a rat model. These studies are an important step in developing a commercial product that can positively impact patient care.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to improve the current spraying practices in agriculture.
    Inefficient crop spraying causes drift which can lead to crop damage or unwanted
    pesticide use in neighboring non-target crop areas. It may contaminate nearby
    bodies of water or be an issue for human health.  Our company would solve this
    through the implementation of a closed loop sensor system which would remotely
    determine the efficiency of sprayer machines and the spray pattern of the material
    continuously and in real time. Farmers will benefit through reduced costs of wasted
    materials resulting from over-spraying, while feeling safe against pest and fungus
    infestation resulting from under-spraying. The initial intended customers are
    large orchards, vineyards and tree farms. Those farmers generally use airblast
    sprayers which are highly inefficient and waste about 45% of the material. Those
    chemicals either hit the ground and contaminate it or pollute the air.  An owner
    of a large farm that implements our proposed device will save a significant amount
    on chemical costs and also avoids the consequences due to drift of chemicals onto
    neighboring farms, public roads, or non-agricultural areas. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    I project proposes to introduce a new technology to the agricultural sector. This
    technology has been previously built for complex and sophisticated applications
    in mostly academia and government sectors. We look to provide a new functionality
    while reducing the size and cost of the technology. It would be used as a new
    and improved method of calibration, replacing a tedious and often ignored current
    process. Furthermore, the sensor would be integrated as a closed loop system for
    autonomous sprayer adjustments. A complete software solution would accompany the
    hardware in order to make it approachable to the non-scientific community. This
    project will prove the potential of our technology as a competitive player in

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is increased revenue and processing potential for scrap recyclers in the US. The artificially-intelligent algorithm designed in this project will enable domestic scrap processors to become more competitive within the material supply chain by giving them the ability to adapt, in real-time, to an ever-changing material consumption climate. With unstable international commodity trade, US scrap processors must reduce reliance on exporting low-value scrap to maintain profitable business models. Additionally, US scrap must exercise optimal processing schedules to prevent scrap surplus domestically while providing consumers with recycled products that are functionally equivalent to new products. The latter offers an environmentally-friendly scrap-to-product option that reduces the energy required for production and the amount of harmful CO2 released. Aluminum scrap recycling has been practiced for decades; however, the majority of post-consumer scrap is downcycled leaving revenue and environmental benefits untapped. Non-ferrous auto-shred was, on average, sold for $0.33/lb. less than its actual value in 2017, which equates to nearly $1 billion in opportunity cost. Artificially intelligent sorting systems will enable scrap processors to reach higher profit margins and meet environmental goals.

    The proposed project will completely automate scrap sortation. The advent of multi-sort capability encourages the need for preliminary research to identify how to operate sensor-based sorters optimally. Artificial intelligence can meet this need. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of an artificially-intelligent algorithm that is capable of optimizing scrap sortation in real-time. The research objectives include:&#8239;(1) identify all data sources in the scrap recycling process that &#8239;can &#8239;influence intelligent decision making (2)&#8239;design a database to host identified data sources such as compositional, market, inventory, and sales data and (3) design a customized artificially-intelligent algorithm for the&#8239; scrap &#8239;recycling industry to develop sorting criteria in real-time. To meet these objectives, a dynamic material flow model will be designed to analyze and host all relevant sensor, market, and experimental data streams to minimize data pre-processing requirements. Concurrently, aluminum scrap will be characterized to investigate how frequently and to what degree composition fluctuates. The database that hosts all supportive data streams will be designed to store and integrate all relevant data streams seamlessly. Finally, using an 80/20 training/testing data split with 5-fold cross-validation, the machine learning algorithm will be selected and optimized to provide the lowest error rate for suggested sorting criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses the immediate need to develop advanced air conditioning technology that increases energy efficiency and will have a significant and positive impact on reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions. As Room Air Conditioning (RAC) demand increases by an estimated 5x over the next 30 years, it is crucial that newly established scientific and technological approaches be developed which lessen the requirement of 'peaker' power plants to supply electricity for their operation. Nativus is engineering an energy-efficient 12,000 BTU Room Air Conditioner (RAC) for residential and light-commercial consumers, capable of cooling 500 ft2. Through a complete architectural redesign, our proprietary technology offers customers a solution to their air conditioning needs which is cheaper to operate, quieter, filters the air, and is easier to install than currently available commercial offerings.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel, rotating air conditioning design which combines the main components of an air conditioner into a single, packaged device to drastically increase air conditioner performance.  The roughly one billion air conditioners in operation globally operate at 5-10% of their theoretical ultimate Carnot efficiency, as industry focuses on "first-cost" and has not demonstrated meaningful, radical improvements since the inception of the air conditioner. The current state-of-the-art technology in the HVAC industry is based upon the 'fan plus finned-tube' (FPFT) Heat Exchanger in which a fan blows air across either hot or cold heat exchanger fins. This architecture results in the formation of an insulative 'boundary layer', severely degrading heat exchanger performance. Through the use of one high-efficiency motor, instead of two or three motors commonly found on state-of-the-art technology, our proprietary design rotationally-shears the boundary layer from the surface of the heat exchanger, thereby increasing efficiency while decreasing power consumption. Our research objectives include air conditioner component and system-level validation, supported by three milestones which include Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) performance validation, system reliability through prototype testing, and economic analysis.  The tasks involved in our project include design, manufacture, assemble, and testing of a complete system.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project involves the creation of particles that
    will allow one to see a map of temperature within a Magnetic Resonance Imaging
    (MRI) measurement.  This is a significant advancement because conventional thermometry
    is usually invasive, allows only single point temperature measurements, and may
    interfere with the therapeutic and imaging instrument. The proposed technology
    is designed to be biocompatible and minimally invasive, leading to fast 3D temperature
    mapping deep in the human body. The proposed materials and techniques can be used
    with MRI-guided thermal procedures which can replace scalpel-based surgery for
    a variety of cancers, improving patient outcomes and reducing surgical time. The
    method can also be used to improve treatments for essential tremor, uterine fibrosis
    and arteriovenous malformation. In these treatments, the temperature in the entire
    affected region must be constantly monitored. Due to the limitations of the currently
    used temperature measurement methods, these minimally invasive MRI-guided procedures
    are not frequently used or take considerably longer time than desired because
    surgeons often must work around failed temperature measurements. The work in this
    proposal could transform current methods of MRI-guided thermometry, significantly
    reducing surgery time and cost as well as improving patient outcomes.  \n\nThis
    proposal develops a novel, minimally-invasive method of creating temperature maps
    superimposed on anatomical MRI images. The technology uses a new type of temperature-sensitive
    sensor, in the form of magnetic nanoparticles, and could ultimately be used within
    human or other tissues.  The key idea is that magnetic particles embedded in tissue
    will create a local dipole magnetic field that will modulate (statically or dynamically)
    the homogeneity of the main static magnetic field of the MRI scanner.  This changes
    the nuclear relaxation times of the tissue and broadens the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
    (NMR) linewidth, ultimately leading to local changes in the brightness of the
    MRI image.  The magnetization of the particles is engineered to change with temperature,
    and therefore the results are temperature dependent. Different shades of gray
    in the weighted gradient echo MR images, can then be calibrated to obtain a spatial
    map of temperature. This has immediate application in providing real-time temperature
    information to the surgeon during MRI-guided thermal interventional procedures
    to treat cancer, for example. These new contrast sensors can operate in a wide
    temperature range both below and above the human body temperature, producing spatial
    maps of temperature with an accuracy better than 1 degree Celsius.\n\nThis award

    This SBIR Phase I project will further the development of an orally administered gene delivery vehicle called the Crypt-Reaching Particle (CRP) that is able to overcome the physical barriers of the mucus to deliver DNA-based drugs to the cells of the gastrointestinal tract. The therapeutic agent will then be expressed as a protein locally in the gastrointestinal tract or be secreted into the bloodstream to treat the full body. Development of this vehicle will lead to novel scientific insights on DNA delivery that will benefit and educate the field of fundamental science and engineering. Successful commercialization would benefit pharmaceutical companies by providing an oral drug delivery platform for approved and novel drugs, U.S. patients by reducing the need for injectable drugs and thereby increasing compliance and quality of life, and payers by reducing costs associated with injectable drugs and improving outcomes by increasing patient compliance via oral administration. The drug-agnostic feature provides broad and diverse market opportunities within the rapidly expanding market for biologics, among other therapeutic agents leading to substantial job creation. As an example, a potential addressable market in four areas (i.e., delivering TNF inhibitors, protein replacement, peptide hormones, and blood factors) exceeds $90 billion per year.

    This project is designed to prepare a stable oral formulation of the Crypt-Reaching Particle (CRP), a novel drug-agnostic drug delivery vehicle, and demonstrate that it can deliver a functional DNA cargo for expression and secretion in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. This project focuses on the technical challenges associated with preserving the functionality of a DNA cargo as an example of a challenging drug delivery scenario that is difficult to replicate. The innovation is the design of the vehicle to penetrate through the mucus and transfect underlying epithelial cells by mimicking the enteric poliovirus. This will lay the foundation for the first oral gene therapy. Briefly, the project will address three objectives. First, preparation of a formulation for the CRP for oral administration via lyophilization with analyses to assess formulation and DNA stability as a function of time, temperature, and pH. Second, testing the ability of the orally formulated CRP to deliver a functional DNA plasmid encoding Gaussia luciferase to Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells in vitro by measuring both cellular and secreted expression. Finally, testing the ability of the orally formulated and administered CRP to deliver a functional Gaussia luciferase plasmid to intestinal epithelial cells in vivo in Fischer 344 rats to assess expression and secretion.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project addresses the unacceptable incidence of
    orthopedic device-related infections, as well as the dangerous rise of antibiotic
    resistant bacteria. More than 100,000 implanted orthopedic fixation devices (pins,
    plates, and screws) acquire bacterial infections each year in the US, accounting
    for approximately $1.5 trillion in associated medical and surgical treatment costs.
    Furthermore, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics to treat these infections has
    led to a dramatic rise in antibiotic resistance, which poses a severe risk to
    human health. This project aims to develop and optimize a commercially viable
    process to impart orthopedic fixation devices with a unique surface nanotexture
    designed to inhibit bacterial attachment and disrupt the biofilm cycle while simultaneously
    stimulating robust implant integration with adjacent bone. Importantly, this treatment
    acts via topography alone and does not incorporate antimicrobial agents or pharmaceuticals.
    Due to the ubiquity and gravity of the infection epidemic, this first-of-its-kind
    antibacterial surface technology is expected to rapidly infiltrate the orthopedic
    device market and drive a dramatic market shift towards the development of products
    with enhanced biological activity. Ultimately, this project has the potential
    to alleviate significant clinical and economic burdens while stimulating technological
    advances in a competitive market. \n\nThe proposed work aims to create an antibacterial
    surface nanotexture by utilizing a proprietary modified atomic deposition technique.
    The fabrication parameters used during this deposition process are closely linked
    to the resulting surface characteristics (and thus its antimicrobial efficacy).
    However, the link between fabrication parameters and antimicrobial efficacy is
    inadequately understood currently. Therefore, the proposed work employs a systematic
    strategy to elucidate the relationships involved and establish control over the
    fabrication process and resulting surface properties. The project is separated
    into four stages, each designed to explore the effect of a specific fabrication
    parameter on performance outcomes, including bacterial colonization, bone cell
    functions, and trends in certain surface properties that often correlate with
    cell-substrate interactions (e.g. surface energy, roughness, skewness, etc.).
    The relationships revealed through testing will be used to build a set of equations
    that describe how the properties of the nanotextured surface vary as a function
    of the fabrication parameters. This set of equations will then be used to optimize
    the system, enabling consistent and controllable operation of the deposition process
    as manufacturing specifications evolve. In addition to advancing the development
    of a market-changing product, the proposed research will contribute to the growing
    understanding of cell and bacteria responses on nanostructured surfaces in an
    ongoing effort to mitigate infection associated with orthopedic implants.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide high-performance light filtering at a level that potentially affects all people in the world. Inexpensive high-performance light filters allow for early detection of cancer and infection by bringing the highest-precision technologies such as fluorescence microscopy and sensing to portable, consumer diagnostic devices. They also make sensors in self-driving cars and other intelligent devices of the future to detect objects in the surroundings more accurately by eliminating the undesired light noise from the ambient and focusing on the target frequencies of light only. Batteries of future mobile devices may also last up to 20% longer due to more efficient light energy management in display units that become possible with low-cost, large-scale optical filters.?Finally,?the anticipated lower manufacturing cost at high volume will allow for more high-tech manufacturing jobs to remain in the US.

    The proposed project will establish the technical feasibility of using a novel multi-material, micro- and nano-layered film production process in order to produce visible and near-infrared thin-film optical filters. The time and cost requirements of conventional, deposition-based production techniques of such filters are a significant barrier to market growth and commercial acceptance of their broad range of uses. In order to address this market gap, this project will investigate the elements necessary for consistent production of filters made of hybrid organic/inorganic materials using the novel process of thermal drawing. This investigation will cover methods of integration and handling of hybrid organic-inorganic materials in the thermal drawing process as well as understanding and controlling fluidic instabilities at interfaces to obtain filter uniformity and integrity. The results of the proposed research will determine whether the novel thermal drawing process, in conjunction with developed materials and handling techniques, can reliably generate high-performance visible and near infrared filters at scale.

    CO2 from fuel gas, producing a valuable high-pressure vapor, in addition to PH-CO2.
    \ HDS technology dramatically reduces the CO2-capture cost and provides a purity
    that enables a profitable B2B model. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to
    develop HDS technology.  Quantitative metrics will be refined and employed to
    develop detailed capital expense and operating cost models.  Two technical hurdles
    must be overcome to reduce these costs.  These hurdles are also opportunities
    for innovation.  The first opportunity is to achieve sufficient volumetric efficiency
    in the pressure vessel for commercial deployment.  The equilibrium state inside
    the HDS module is perfect separation.  Increasing the rate of approach to that
    equilibrium state reduces the size and cost of the HDS module. This will be accomplished
    by exploiting the synergy between fluid state, surface state, fluid motion, and
    gravity.  This synergy coalesces CO2, allowing its rapid separation from the remaining
    components of flue gas and fuel gas.  The second opportunity is to achieve sufficient
    overall process efficiency for commercial deployment.  The power required for
    compression determines operating expense.  Our strategy involves operating the
    near-isothermal cold compression train and near-isothermal hot expansion train
    as a heat engine (an approximation of the Ericsson cycle).  In this manner, innovative
    gerotor compressors and expanders work together with heat exchangers using waste
    heat to reduce or eliminate operating costs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to bring to the market a faster and cheaper means of gathering highly accurate local air quality.  This will be done through the use of miniaturization of chemical sensors that are carried by UAVs.  Not only will there be technical hurdles that will be overcome through the implementation of this means of gathering data, the use of UAVs in this manner pushes the boundaries of their use in urban areas in a way that has not been done before.  The societal and commercial impact will be to reduce cost and time in obtaining air quality at a point in time and space, thereby making air quality measurements less of a financial and technical burden to governments, organizations and corporations.  This progress will help ensure that communities can address air quality concerns through the data gathered.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to implement a novel means to couple a low-cost technology to detect when chemical components reach a given threshold in the air with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a means of delivering the sensors to a specified location.  The sensor technology utilizes colorimetric detection of chemicals.  Off-the-shelf colorimetric sensors, combined with a unique algorithm, produce color difference maps for toxic industrial chemicals at their permissible exposure level (PEL) concentrations.  The objective of the research is to determine if the proposed approach will allow for accurate chemical sensing for a precise location.  It is anticipated that the technology to be utilized will allow for an accurate capture of a broad range of pollutants and chemical compounds along with concentration levels.

    Research (SBIR) project is the development and widespread adaptation of next generation

    a newly-discovered high-quality graphene network, consisting of incommensurately-stacked
    multilayer graphene (IMLG) assembled in three-dimensional (3D) form. It exhibits
    unique structural and electrical properties that enable the reversible intercalation

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Project (SBIR) project is the development of a platform for pathogen identification and other genomic applications that achieves rapid, sensitive, multiplexed single-molecule detection.  The genomic diagnostics market is poised to grow to $40 billion by 2021.  The goal of this platform will be to offer multiplexed detection of more than 1,000 pathogens, allowing accurate point-of-care diagnosis of infectious diseases.  Other genomic applications that also are possible include assessment of the microbiome or monitoring opportunistic infections in pulmonary diseases.  In addition, the platform has the potential for use in genomic sequencing, a market that is expected to reach $9 billion by 2020.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a highly multiplexed, bioelectronic, label-free assay platform capable of real-time, label-free detection of thousands of nucleic acid targets without amplification. This will be accomplished  through the use of nanoscale single-molecule field-effect transistors (smFETs) on a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated-circuit platform, which fully leverages the economies of scale of modern semiconductor manufacturing. The initial target application for this technology is multiplexed pathogen identification at the point-of-need. This project will bring the technology to wafer-scale manufacturing, which will both improve device quality and lower the per device cost of manufacture, and demonstrate proof-of-concept for genomic detection (without amplification) on clinical samples.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is as diverse as the laser technology itself.  Lasers have become the true facilitator of the data-based society.  It is tool of choice for future smart factories and on-demand manufacturing.  It serves as the fundamental building block of optical sensing systems used to collect large volumes of critical data to be used for decision making in every facet of society.  The myriad of new applications for laser systems echoes the same demand ? higher power.  The bottleneck in the power generation is often the capability of optical components of the laser to withstand the power without degradation.  So the greater potential of lasers can be unleashed if there would be a way to break through the power handling capability of laser components starting with the nonlinear optical crystals indispensable in creating these powerful energy sources.  This research project is precisely designed to address this need and the successful completion of this project would enable the next generation of miniaturized electronic devices, expand our horizon of biological imagery and precision surgery, and explore our universe with instruments that are currently confined to our laboratories.

    The proposed project targets the most common material used to generate high power visible and UV light ? Lithium Triborate (LBO) crystal.  Able to handle power density up to 45GW/cm2, LBO is currently the material of choice for high energy industrial lasers.  However, optical surfaces where the light enter and exit LBO often get damaged well before the actual bulk material.  Traditional dielectric anti-reflective (AR)  coatings on these surfaces are typically made using a limited selection of materials of lower damage threshold in a process highly susceptible to contamination, resulting in significantly lower damage threshold than the bulk LBO crystal.  In this proposal, state-of-the-art surface-texturing processes on LBO will be developed to eliminate the use of these dielectric films while still providing the necessary AR functionality.  A variety of processes and materials on LBO surfaces will be attempted and studied with resulting surfaces tested for absorption and damage threshold.

    of battery technologies. The race for the perfect battery is intensifying due
    to growing global demand for both the electric vehicle (EV) and stationary storage
    industries. The search is on for new ways to improve energy and power density,
    reduce charging time, and extend battery life. The project will create a diagnostic
    tool that provides an unprecedented glimpse inside the battery and has the potential
    to accelerate scientific understanding of how batteries age. A more accurate assessment
    of battery degradation in real time can inform on-board algorithms, can improve
    overall battery pack efficiency, and has major cost saving impacts for automakers
    and stationary storage users. This predictability enables more cost-effective
    warranty management, improved charging and safety algorithms, and ever more efficient
    battery pack designs.  Having a sense of remaining useful life also enables the
    battery to be re-used in a secondary application - creating new business opportunities
    while a new revenue stream making batteries more sustainable.  Ultimately, this
    reduces costs for both consumers and manufacturers, and contributes to greener
    use of resources for society. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project unlocks key insights for large-format lithium batteries. Today?s
    battery management systems (BMS) do not track a battery?s actual degradation metrics
    so it cannot forecast remaining useful life. This makes it hard to predict the
    ?cliff?, a sudden and steep drop in capacity near a battery?s end of life.  This
    forces battery makers to overdesign battery systems to reduce chances of premature
    failure before the warranty expiration. The proposed research employs electrochemical
    impedance spectroscopy (EIS) onboard a BMS.  EIS is a diagnostic tool that measures
    battery impedance - something only possible in a lab setting today. Tracking impedance
    unlocks a lifetime of degradation data and helps battery engineers better understand
    the long-term degradation behavior of high voltage battery packs. The project
    will focus on 1) minimizing the required hardware to measure impedance of each
    cell in a series-connected battery pack, and 2) reducing the down-time associated
    with the impedance measurement. The proposed innovation blends a unique hardware
    architecture with wide-bandgap semiconductors and adaptive charge-control algorithms
    to minimize hardware size. These help to reduce overall system cost and unlocks
    orders of magnitude improvement in hardware scalability over existing EIS methods.\n\nThis

    in the area of machine condition monitoring. Vibration monitoring is an integral
    part of any machine condition monitoring regimen. All equipment that comprise
    belts, gears, bearings, drive motors, or other moving components have a specific
    vibration signature during normal operating cycles. Change in equipment vibration
    serves as an early warning of a decline in operating condition and signals the
    need for preventative maintenance to avoid more serious equipment faults and failure.
    \ Due to extremely small form-factor and wireless signal detection scheme of the
    sensing tag in the proposed vibration monitoring system of this project, simple
    and cost-effective direct measurement of vibration from hard-to-access parts of
    machinery (e.g. rotor in an electric motor) is enabled. This will have a significant

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to commercially develop an in vitro (cell culture) platform to enhance the efficiency of drug discovery. Every drug delivered to a human engages the network of blood vessels for delivery to the target tissue or as part of the removal. An essential feature of the blood vessel network is an extensive network of small vessels surrounded by smooth muscle which can contract and dilate to control blood flow, and thus drug delivery. There are no in vitro human platforms that can mimic this biological function, despite the fact that cardiovascular toxicity is the leading cause of failure in clinical trials. As such, a pre-clinical tool to assess vascular toxicity would significantly impact the drug development process. Developing a successful drug averages 10-12 years and nearly $2.6 billion. Despite the fact that ~60% of the total development costs are spent on human clinical trials, fewer than 1 in 10 entering clinical trials will succeed. There is a significant opportunity to improve the accuracy of preclinical drug screening which, in turn, will generate dramatic cost savings and shorten time-to-market. The company's proposed vasoactive human vascular network represents a leap forward in technology to simulate the human response to new and existing drugs. Furthermore, the platform technology has broad future applications including the incorporation of tissue specific function (e.g, human tumor cells) and patient specificity which will further advance drug development and precision medicine.

    There are currently no in vitro platforms that can mimic vasoconstriction or vasorelaxation, processes which require vasoresponsive smooth muscle cells. Competing technologies line prefabricated tubes or membranes with endothelial cells to mimic the vasculature which will never be able to simulate vasoactivity. Since the company's platform is comprised of living dynamic microvessels, the company is uniquely positioned to create a platform with this functionality. The primary objective is to develop a 3D perfused human vascular network with smooth muscle providing the capacity to characterize vasoactive substances. The company will achieve the primary objective by completing two specific aims: 1) Incorporate human smooth muscle cells into a 3D in vitro vascular network; and 2) Quantify the dose-response of the 3D perfused vessel network to a panel of vasoactive drugs. Achieving vasoactive functionality in an in vitro vascular network will be the first demonstration of this critical biological phenomenon, and will meet an important commercial need in the pharmaceutical industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of drone-based technology to manage fires more safely, efficiently, and effectively.  Wildfires cause hundreds of billions of dollars in annual damages in the United States. As the size and number of wildfires increases, prescribed fires have emerged as one of the most cost-effective tools to reduce catastrophic damage by removing excess fuel for wildfires and controlling their evolution. Yet, to be most effective, prescribed fires require putting people in the proximity of fire and are often limited by the unavailability (due to cost or demand) of fast delivery mechanisms such as those provided by helicopters. This effort will result in technology that directly addresses both pain points by improving the intelligence of drone-based fire monitoring and ignition systems. This project has the potential to shape how fire management is conducted in the future, making it safer for fire personnel and enabling cost-effective prescribed fire practices that can help society to control catastrophic wildfires and better manage landscapes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development of drone-based technology that will transform fire management. Current drone-based ignition and monitoring systems have the potential to change the field but are hampered by their extensive reliance on human controllers. This lack of automation limits these systems? potential applicability, scale, effectiveness, and unnecessarily increases their risk. The proposed work aims to make monitoring and ignition more intelligent and scalable through: 1) specialized machine learning pipelines to characterize fire fronts and identify ground assets; 2) light-weight fire simulation engine that can provide short-horizon prediction of the fire front evolution while executing on limited computer power; and 3) distributed planning algorithms that adjust the drone's trajectory and sphere drop strategy to manipulate fire intensity while keeping ground assets, vehicles, and personnel safe. These challenges are especially difficult to address given the harsh fire environment, the weight and power constraints of commercial drones preferred for these activities, and the integration of two distinct domains, drone navigation and fire management.

    that enable the rapid measurement of the handedness of molecular mixtures.   Like
    screws and keys, many molecules possess a certain handedness that can be important
    when interacting with living systems.  This issue is vital to pharmaceutical research,
    where one handed form of a drug may result in benefits while the opposite form
    may cause harmful side effects.  Consequently, measuring the handedness of molecular
    mixtures is of paramount importance in modern pharmaceutical research.  However,
    conventional approaches to making these measurements are often too slow for modern
    pharmaceutical discovery and development research where high-throughput experiments
    on hundreds or even thousands of samples per day are performed.  This project
    aims to remove this bottleneck by leveraging a recently introduced new instrument
    and commercializing reagent kits that have been shown in academic laboratories
    to achieve a much faster and simpler method for measuring the handedness of molecular
    mixtures.  Making this improved technology widely available to the greater research
    and development community has the potential to streamline drug development efforts
    at reduced cost and minimized waste production, which is expected to increase
    profit margins and create new jobs in research, development and manufacturing,
    resulting in substantial benefit to the health and economy of the United States.
    \ \n\nThe innovation of this project comprises a series of optical sensors, developed

    traditional techniques such as chiral HPLC, to evaluate the robustness in the
    presence of potential interferants, and to apply a sensor in the analysis of an
    asymmetric reaction using multi-well plate technology. The development of a user-friendly
    kit will include the testing of different methods for the creation of pre-dispensed
    dried sensors that can be reconstituted without leaving behind residues that might
    increase the error margin beyond a few percent which is generally acceptable for
    high-throughput screening applications. The final outcome will be a convenient

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to, firstly, shed light on the benefits and limitations of mm-wave backscatter technologies in challenging industrial environments. More importantly, the lessons learned during this project could, if successful, bring about the emergence of breakthrough energy-autonomous real-time tracking technologies that would significantly increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of worldwide container shipping as well as provide a direct value that could bring about the adoption of the smart container. The container shipping industry stands as one of the unsung heroes of the modern world which, from its birth in the 1960s, cut the cost of shipping goods across the globe by several orders of magnitude, thereby enabling global trade on a massive scale and catalyzing the world?s economic development. Nevertheless, this industry has remained largely unmoved by the advent of big data and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This innovation could empower the general introduction and leveraging of such tools, further lower the costs and increase the accessibility of worldwide shipping, and significantly benefit the world and the United States? economies.

    The proposed project will require, on the road towards commercialization, the exploration of the properties of backscatter mm-wave localization approaches and channels in complex highly cluttered environments such as that of metallic-parts-crowded repair facilities and terminals covered with container stacks. While significant research efforts are currently invested in the characterization and mapping of mm-wave transmission channels necessary to the planning and rolling out of upcoming cellular 5G networks, no such work has yet been reported for their backscatter counterparts, nor for localization purposes. In addition, although the influence of channels for standard Radio Frequency IDentification-based localization systems has benefited from decades of investigation, that of its higher-frequency correspondent is virtually unexplored and should display different properties and present novel challenges and opportunities, due to major differences in clutter diffraction and absorption. The work will start with the finalization of tag and reader hardware in view of the gathering of detection data in the aforementioned environments, followed by the formulation of the high-performance signal processing schemes used to retrieve tag positions and identities, developed hand in hand with optimized communications modulation schemes for the tags. Finally, a tuning of the devised numerical processing schemes for high-speed embedded processing will take place.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is empowering the 68 million U.S. natural gas consumers to know their transaction status in real time, have more and continual control of their transactions, settle transactions in increments less than the industry?s current monthly accounting cycle and enjoy an extremely high level of security. Their transaction cost will be reduced and speed increased, freeing industry capacity and resources to be employed elsewhere at greater value. This innovation will allow others in the natural gas industry to better consider transaction processes and themselves innovate - employing many minds on industry efficiency. This innovation will also have application to other industries characterized by multiple complex, multi-party transactions; particularly the electric utility industry and possibly providing the catalyst for more extensive deregulation and consumer control.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to discover how to transform complex natural gas utility transaction management processes using Blockchain innovations and related technologies across production, transmission, distribution and consumption functions. The United States utility industry has operated in its present physical form for more than a century. Over the past four decades the industry has evolved through various policy and regulatory actions to open transaction participation to thousands of parties. During the past two decades, digital technologies enabled transaction functions to talk to each other and perform some functions automatically. Despite this progress, utility transaction management processes are essentially those created decades ago. They still require significant human intervention, remain highly segmented and employ little digital intelligence and security technology available today. The various technologies now supporting the industry?s seven step transaction processes will be mapped, assessed for Blockchain technology application and then consolidated into a single platform. The key challenge is to create transformative technology integrating the numerous other existing technology applications and data exchange formats and protocols without succumbing to customization which then mutes the transformative nature of the innovation and renders it ineffective as a platform to subsequent industry innovation by multiple parties.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a safe, natural, long-lasting and effective mosquito repellent product by exploiting the natural repellent compounds present in the skin microbiome.  Mosquito-borne illnesses affect 700M people worldwide and cause several million deaths each year.  Chikungunya, West Nile, Malaria, Zika, Dengue, are just some of the debilitating vectors spread by mosquitoes. Mosquito-derived diseases cost >$6.8B/year and the market for mosquito repellents is >$3.2B and growing. Many solutions are aimed at killing and disabling mosquitoes, but mosquitoes are a crucial part of the ecological food chain. Further, many repellents are extremely toxic, and mosquitoes are developing resistance. The proposed technology will be used to identify compounds that will drive the endogenous skin microbiome to a more mosquito repellent phenotype. Using these methods, it is possible to harness the biochemistry contained in the native skin microbiome to create an endogenous repellency that is a safe, natural, environmentally friendly, and effective barrier to mosquitoes. It is expected that this repellency approach may be used safely even with children and pregnant women. In addition, it may be possible to use this approach to develop repellents for multiple insects, repellent products for companion animals, and additional over-the-counter skin products.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a new class of topical insect repellents by influencing repellency in the skin microbiome.  This will be accomplished by developing and validating a platform technology to identify compounds produced by the microbiome that are associated with biochemical pathways of interest, and use the identified compounds to target those pathways whose end-products comprise natural mosquito-repellent compounds. The goal is to create a topical mosquito repellent product. For this project, the plan is to complete metagenome sequencing on skin samples collected from individuals that are either naturally repellent or attractive to Anopheles mosquitoes (the mosquito that carries Malaria). The next step is to predict metabolite compound turnover and use metabolomics to validate the results. In vitro assays and in silico models will be used to provide proof-of-concept for the use of those predicted compounds to induce the microbiota to produce mosquito repellent metabolites.

    This STTR Phase I project aims to bring together computational thinking, mechanism design, and design process to create a new framework for design-driven robotics education for K-12 schools and camps. This work would result in a platform for 1) teaching students Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) topics and 2) providing them critical hands-on experience designing, prototyping, and programming machines. By enabling students to exercise their creativity via an intuitive design interface and a minimalist novel robot kit, this project advances the students' ability to innovate and invent machines and robots. Driven by a need to keep pace with the evolving techno- and socio-economic requirements and remain competitive, schools and camps are increasingly adopting STEM and Robotics programs and products. This framework would fill that void that currently exists in the educational market. This project is closely aligned with the NSF's mandate to support development of a strong STEM workforce. The proposed design-driven educational robotics framework has the potential to fulfill these needs, improve public scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology, and positively impact the U.S. educational robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2021.

    The proposed research seeks to develop a novel design-driven educational robotics framework encompassing 1) a modular, customizable, and compatible with off-the shelf electronics hardware kit consisting of rigid and compliant parts for rapid prototyping of robot structures and mechanisms, 2) a multi-modal mobile app for synthesis and simulation of robot motions, 3) a web-based CAD interface for designing users' custom robot parts that interface seamlessly with the kit, and 4) instructional material and curriculum for middle and high-schools. The hardware would provide a suite of planar parts with unique design capabilities to support creation of 3D geometry of robots and structures. The novel structural elements would give rise to a new method of enforcing geometric and kinematic constraints and provide flexibility in choice of material and manufacturing process. While the new connection methods are much more intuitive and simpler, they also closely mirror the way engineered structures are created in practice. The mobile app based on the latest mechanism synthesis research imbued with a multi-modal graphical user interface will allow creation of robot assemblies and their motions before constructing their corresponding physical models and provide necessary skills and experience in the design process.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop new methods for training and assessing the skill of providing and receiving constructive feedback in collaborative environments. The United States higher education system is failing to train collaboration skills, despite companies listing it as one of the most important skills for new hires to have. Past research has identified specific types of feedback that most effectively encourage peers to improve, but today's higher education instructors have no ready means to effectively assess students' abilities to use these peer feedback strategies. This project will develop simple-to-use software tools to help instructors train peer feedback skills and new methods for automatically assessing student ability to provide and receive constructive feedback. By democratizing the training of the collaborative skills most sought after by today's employers, this project aims to reduce underemployment of college graduates and increase the economic output and tax revenues of the United States by building a better trained and more productive workforce.

    This project will develop an innovative peer-assessment tool coupled with novel natural language processing methods producing accurate measurements of student ability to give and receive constructive feedback based on written feedback. The natural language processing methods will combine word vectors for efficient language processing, a generalizable neural net structure for sentence categorization outlined in existing research literature, and manually defined features based on existing peer feedback research. Research efforts will focus on gathering a large training dataset from partnering higher education classrooms, and iteratively refining a deep-learning natural language processing algorithm to achieve a target 90% accuracy. Automating this assessment process will allow broad and continuous assessment of student collaborative ability without requiring expensive and time-consuming retraining of the United States instructor workforce.

    This SBIR Phase I project advances a novel medical optical spectroscopy device to facilitate accurate diagnosis of middle ear infections.  The device uses a custom multi-LED microchip and photodetectors to illuminate the middle ear and collect reflected light in a familiar otoscope form-factor.   Reflected light signatures are analyzed to determine the presence or absence of middle ear fluid - a hallmark of middle ear infection.  The focus is to optimize product design and algorithm to enable gold standard accuracy across thousands of mass manufactured devices and millions of patients.  The device will be a cost effective means to achieving improved ear infection diagnosis in primary care where it is most needed.  Roughly 90% of children experience at least one ear infection before age 5 and misdiagnosis of suspected ear infection is the leading cause of unnecessary pediatric antibiotic use in the US.  Collectively, ear infection results in at least $5B direct healthcare costs annually in the US and billions more in lost parent productivity.  Improving ear infection diagnosis has the potential to eliminate millions of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions - a crucial step in mitigating development of resistant microorganisms.  Addressing this challenge requires a product that is cost-effective and consistently accurate.

    This project will enable the first commercially available optical spectroscopy product for middle ear effusion and the only known method capable of accurately assessing ear health in very waxy ears.  Although optical spectroscopy as a scientific method is widely practiced, comparatively few commercial medical products exist.  High-cost, bulky spectrometer units are a primary limitation restricting development of products tailored to primary care and other low margin medical specialties where there is great need.  The proposed work enables cost-effective manufacture and deployment of the proposed device for ear infection and will be a platform for other next-generation, LED-based optical spectroscopy medical devices.  The investigators will develop an algorithmic scheme to correct variability in mass manufactured LED and photodiode components and design and construct test systems to automatically apply corrections to each completed medical device assembly.  The resultant methods and systems will enable deployment of medical optical spectroscopy systems at up to 100X lower unit cost as compared to spectrometer based systems.  The resultant device for ear infection will enable clinicians to more easily adhere to American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines for treating ear infections in primary care where there is greatest need.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the commercialization of organic
    light-emitting diode (OLED) technology.  For color displays (TV, cell phone, computer,

    in terms of energy usage, display color space, viewing angle, etc.  For lighting,
    OLED fixtures use very low energy, the light is soft, casts no shadow, and is
    architecturally flexible.  OLED is the display and lighting technology of the
    future.  However cost and short device lifetime has retarded commercial advancement.
    \ The introduction of an entirely new class of materials for OLED manufacturing
    will enable this advancement. \n\nThe proposed project will reduce OLED cost and
    improve performance by utilizing a new class of photoelectric materials for the
    nanometer thick layers that comprise an OLED.  OLED layers utilize single-component
    small molecules for the charge transporting and light-emitting layers.  These
    molecules tend to crystallize and are poor solvents for the emitting molecules
    leading to decreased light emission efficiency and shortened device lifetime.
    \ The innovation is using isomeric mixtures of designed molecules that are amorphous

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a cost-effective high-performance platform to monitor and characterize phytoplankton and other microorganisms in water. Some of these aquatic microorganisms may be toxic or even fatal resulting in significant public health concerns (such as recent "red tide" events in Florida, USA) and drastic economic consequences (i.e. deadly effects of harmful algal blooms on the aquaculture industry). The current state of the art in monitoring technology includes laborious and expensive manual sample collection and evaluation using a benchtop microscope or optical digital imaging system. In contrast, the proposed platform will be transformative by enabling low-cost, portable and fast monitoring and automated characterization of aquatic microorganisms. Therefore, this platform will revolutionize monitoring of aquatic microorganisms and, being low cost, it will enable a much wider application of the technology to other markets. Some of these future applications include more efficient biofuels research and development (via algae monitoring), marine biology science and education, general monitoring of particles and pathogens at the water treatment facilities, production algae monitoring. Therefore, the potential societal impact and commercial potential of the proposed technology is transformative.

    The proposed project aims to develop and evaluate a portable, rapid, durable and environmentally-stable imaging flow-cytometry technology that will automatically monitor microorganisms, such as phytoplankton and pathogens present in the flowing water, and will be capable of specific classification. Existing optics-based flow-cytometry solutions are expensive and not durable for field use. Unlike lab-based flow cytometers or hand-held assays, the proposed system will not rely on reagents or labeling, and therefore will not need an expert/professional, and will keep the evaluated water unchanged. Thus, it can be installed for continual unattended operation and will be much more cost-effective per test due to elimination of an expert's time, costly reagents and fluorophores. Furthermore, the proposed system will also be integrated with a machine learning engine capable of automated identification of microorganisms as well as other micro-objects of interest. Finally, the proposed system will be evaluated on pre-collected samples of local coastal ocean water to determine the presence of three example types of phytoplankton microorganisms and to provide statistical distribution of all of the detected micro-objects. Therefore, the proposed system will be transformative and provide an innovative and unique capability to expediently survey samples of water and automatically characterize identified micro objects.

    This SBIR Phase I project will study and develop methods to provide adult professionals and young adult students with the skills and self-confidence to pursue studies and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. Today, a large segment of society identifies as being underrepresented in the technology sector. Some individuals experience low technology-related self-confidence as a result. At a time when the United States has an increasing demand for technology workers, the country needs contributions from all segments of society, and not simply those segments which have been privileged in the past, to meet this demand and maintain U.S. competitive advantage in the global innovation economy. Engaging people from the full spectrum of the United States population will enable innovative companies to leverage more diverse sources of creativity, build better solutions to today's problems, and create more jobs. When people see themselves as future practitioners of a technical skill, it is possible to learn topics in a deeper, more fulfilling, and more enduring manner. Commercializing this invention will increase online learning platform retention rates, driving revenue not only within educational companies but within the companies who hire the resulting talent.


    The proposed technology is innovative because no commercially-available software tools exist which support metacognitive development in tandem with technical skill acquisition. This innovation is risky because no one has proven that having a positive influence on metacognition through automated software is even possible during single learning session. The goal of this research is to deliver techniques for enhancing the self-efficacy of STEM learners within the context of online learning platforms. The project combines best practices in digital personalization and educational psychology research to deliver customized content responsive to learner preferences and learner attitude attributes. The proposed research will demonstrate, via a random trial, increased levels of motivation and engagement in students who receive targeted interventions as compared with a control population. Using survey instruments, the researchers will measure changes in self-efficacy, challenge-seeking, and goal-setting behavior. Because the research team has unique experience in developing proven educational interventions which enhance self-efficacy across a variety of learning domains, the algorithms and methods inside the proposed technology will be difficult for competitors to replicate. This SBIR project will deliver algorithms and automated, web-based interventions to help all STEM learners experience personal engagement with STEM topics and find empowerment in the task of learning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. Agriculture is one of the most important industries impacting the economy, society, and the environment. By automating harvesting of fresh produce, society's ability to grow healthy and sustainable food will increase substantially. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding of how to deploy commercially viable multi-robot coordinated groups performing complex automated tasks, in agriculture and beyond. The long-term opportunity for agricultural robotics is $150B+. This innovation focuses on controlled-environment methods, which are more intensive in terms of capital and labor, but far less intensive in terms of water, chemical use, and fertilizer use. If robots can reduce manual labor of large-scale production, and enhance human management precision, it will enable intensive agriculture practices to compete with, and in some cases supplant, traditional chemical-, labor-, and water-intensive approaches. This will make the US a more competitive global producer of high-quality produce, increase food security, increase access to healthy food for all people, and protect natural resources and the environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the fields of Robotic Applications, including computer vision/machine learning and robotics controls, by solving critical problems faced when operating in highly dynamic yet precise biological environments like farms. 1) By evolving and combining approaches from the forefront of computer vision, the project will improve environment sensing of e.g. clusters of fruit, their locations, conditions, precise locations of stems and obstacles. 2) Using that information, the project will develop innovative approaches to complex planning problems where leaves, stems, and obstacles interfere with optimal harvesting but are movable. This will be done with millimeter-level precision, where current autonomous planning approaches operate on multi-centimeter precision. 3) Lastly, the project will combine environmental data with 3D reconstructions of grow operations and individual fruit tracking in order to provide better sampling data to forecast production on a 1-4-week basis, and eventually build a deep learning model. This project is critical to achieving the commercial threshold of performance for robotic harvesting services, including high percent of berries picked, acceptable speed of picking, and the provision of climate sensing and forecast information.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop Virtual Reality (VR) based curriculum for first year university science courses. VR has the potential to create a step change in the way STEM education is taught and ultimately the way students learn. This project aims to build VR science curriculum to make science education more accessible, engaging and effective, and turn traditional STEM leavers into stayers which will positively impact STEM retention to meet the U.S. workforce demand. The VR science curriculum will be used alongside the existing curriculum at universities, with students participating in one 30-minute virtual lesson a week. The effect of these lessons on the students' performance will be measured to validate the ability of VR to positively impact learning outcomes. This project supports the NSF mission by progressing the science of education, by developing education tools using the scientific method, and measuring effectiveness. Moreover, the focus on improving university science education will improve the workforce pipeline, creating more and better prepared scientists. The products resulting from the proposed work will make science more accessible preparing today's students to be tomorrow's inventors, problem solvers and next great minds.

    The intellectual merit of this project is in the approach to developing VR curricula, and continually validating each curriculum by using data science to correlate student performance in the lesson to their performance in the classroom. Each lesson combines exposition, active learning, problem-based inquiry and assessment into self-contained modules which can be added to any existing curriculum. Student actions, and concept mastery are tracked within each lesson; ultimately, to correlate what the student is doing in a VR lesson to their learning outcome in real time. This enables the project team to validate which components of each lesson are working to improve student learning outcomes, and continually refine the VR pedagogy. This approach to developing each lesson and the cycle of refinement is the key innovation of the project team. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the magnitude of learning outcome improvement achieved when VR lessons are added to existing curricula, correlate the student actions in the VR lesson to their learning outcome as measured through in-class assessments, and evaluate perceived implementation hurdles for use of VR by instructors. This will be accomplished by integrating VR lessons in university curriculum and measuring the results against a control group. Instructor feedback will be gathered through a mixed methods study.

    This SBIR Phase I project is focused on continued development of a software platform that is used by students for peer to peer homework and studying help. After school help has historically been delivered by tutors and homework hotlines but those avenues have been proven to be inadequate in closing learning gaps for students after they exit the classroom. The proposed technology is expected to further democratize homework and studying help. Being peer to peer, the proposed technology can radically shrink the cost of personalized homework and studying help for students at their own time and pace - especially the ones from economically or socially more challenged backgrounds. The project will also explore use of an innovative business model to optimize commercial viability with impacting a broad range of students irrespective of their backgrounds. It is expected that when fully developed, the technology would emerge as a scalable low-cost option to help improve student learning outcomes both nationally and globally.

    The key intellectual merit of this project is in the development of a Smart Study Recommendations Engine. This involves harvesting the data from the class notes uploaded by students, analyze it to surface predictive insights and automatically deliver the notes or wide-ranging peer-reviewed study materials directly to the student users based on their learning styles, learning abilities, and learning gaps, without requiring them to perform a search. It will also provide them with an ability to connect them with peers who can provide additional support. Thus, this project seeks to provide personalized study playlists based on a student profile and pair them with a peer mentor who can provide deeper clarifications as required. The key outcome to be demonstrated is that 1 in 5 students engages favorably with the auto delivered math notes, helped by a peer who can provide clarity and tutoring as needed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will provide new opportunities for purifying waters that cannot be economically treated using existing commercial membranes.  Increased market growth to include recycle and re-use of contaminated water that is currently slated for disposal or long term environmentally risky storage will increase water availability for industry and agriculture and reduce environmental impact from these same users.  More available water, especially in higher demand locations, will lead to higher production and lower costs for industrial and agriculture based consumers, leading to job growth.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to validate a new method of thin film composite membrane fabrication using new materials strategies to produce game changing anti-fouling and chlorine resistant reverse osmosis membranes.  Current market dominating polyamide thin film composite (TFC) membranes are inherently susceptible to fouling and degraded by chlorine disinfectants used to mitigate bio-fouling, which is the greatest challenge to membrane operation.  The established TFC production technique provides very thin active layers on the order of 100?s of nanometers but is limited to polyamides.  The proposed technology will produce TFCs with alternative polymers.  Polymers that are chlorine resistant and inherently non-fouling are targeted for use but the unmet challenge has been the opportunity to manufacture them with membrane thicknesses down to the 100?s of nm thickness regime necessary to challenge the flux properties of current commercial membranes.  Combining this new fabrication technology and new polymers is the technological breakthrough needed to develop innovative membranes.  The project will synthesize a target polymer composition, develop the formulation and fabrication parameters within the new process and produce TFC samples for testing.  TFC samples will undergo comparative testing of fouling and chlorine resistance, water flux and salt rejection in a variety of simulated test waters.

    This SBIR Phase I project is focused on demonstrating the feasibility of an innovative crowdfunding process to effectively support and grow the fourth sector economy at the local community level. This fourth sector economy, a blend of three traditional economic sectors (public, private and nonprofit) is poised to solve many of the world's most difficult and complex social problems; however, this sector cannot work effectively without a supportive ecosystem that enables the creation, funding, and operation of organizations within it. This project proposes an innovative Fourth Sector Ecosystem incubator that brings a coordinated suite of services to local communities to engage them, educate them, and provide financial capital through a crowdfunding platform. This project will engage four communities in a pilot study designed to engage and educate key leaders, energize advocacy for fourth-sector growth, and catalyze fourth-sector social enterprises by offering capital access through crowdfunding. The validation of this grass-roots scalable educational and participatory incubator will enable communities to support local for-benefit businesses who will improve the quality of life in their communities, create jobs, and contribute to the economy, leading to expansion of this model across the nation and globally.


    The innovation inherent in this educational platform is the synergy between the components of its scalable, turnkey process to provide a catalyst for fourth-sector business growth. Innovative components include a robust, secure crowdfunding platform, educational training for community leaders and businesses in fourth-sector principles, assessment methods to evaluate/provide continuous improvement of the process, gamification that rewards fourth-sector-supporting behaviors; and network-building processes. The goals of this research are to determine the performance, design and educational training specifications that will address the needs of all stakeholders (e.g., entrepreneurs, community leaders, contributors), and demonstrate the feasibility of this platform through a pilot study in four communities. Methods will focus on continuous evaluation and feedback from stakeholders in the four communities to determine best methods to teach communities to manage their incubators, activate their communities to participate, achieve campaign success, demonstrate improved learning outcomes from the training, and increase the density and reciprocity of networks in the pilot communities. Surveys and data will be collected and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of each component in the process, from planning to implementation to assessment, as shown through survey results, expansion of networks, and funding raised by fourth sector enterprises using the crowdfunding tool.

    This SBIR Phase I project will provide children ages 7-11 years with an interactive learning program that cultivates core leadership skills. This project goes deeper than many traditional socio-emotional programs by fortifying children with the behavioral skills and mindset they need to evolve as effective leaders. The educational curriculum was developed by psychologists who specialize in leadership development, and is based on cutting-edge child developmental, leadership, and educational research. This project aims to research the engagement and effectiveness of the program and its ability to enhance ten core leadership behaviors in youth, at home, in the community, and in academic settings. This program has the potential to make a long-term impact on the next generation of youth, promoting resilience in the face of adverse events, such as school violence and cyberbullying, and to positively shape the next generation of leaders, helping them form lifelong commitments to personal and professional development. The project has philanthropic aspirations to make the educational curriculum available to all children and schools, regardless of socio-economic standing, supporting the mission of NSF to promote the health, prosperity and welfare of the nation through science.


    This project is focused on the development of an interactive leadership program for children, that is proven to make a positive impact on leadership behaviors and that is also fun and engaging for youth and their adult caregivers and educators. What sets this program apart from others is that the research will provide evidence that the program builds the critical skills it intends on developing in children. The program is designed to be self-led or facilitated by an adult caregiver or educator, either using an online platform or physical materials.  As children move from one leadership competency to another, they are extrinsically and intrinsically rewarded for their efforts. Adult caregivers and educators are encouraged to participate and are provided mastery building exercises that help them take the child?s leadership understanding and skill to the next level. A database has been developed to track real-time participant feedback as curriculum elements are developed. The testing of educational content will focus on three aspects, which include maximizing content appropriateness, validating learning and skill retention, and assessing variances and preferences for mode of delivery. Results will be used to make modifications to the curriculum and product design for commercialization.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the development of an effective and sustainable alternative
    to antibiotics and biocides used in animal feed, which will help mitigate the
    global health threat of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The beef cattle industry
    is under increasing regulatory and public pressure to reduce or eliminate the
    use of antibiotic feed additives as they are considered a major factor driving
    the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, in-feed antibiotics
    provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits to the cattle industry
    by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. This project provides
    an alternative for these conflicting concerns by providing a cost-effective alternative
    to in-feed antibiotics. Further, with sufficient understanding of how the rumen
    microbiome impacts animal physiology and performance, this technology could be
    easily adapted to selectively target microbial species that reduce animal growth
    or feed efficiency, or that produce methane, increasing the economic and environmental
    sustainability of livestock agriculture. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop a low-dose, bacteriophage-based feed additive that can be prophylactically
    administered to control the growth of pathogenic Fusobacterium necrophorum in
    cattle rumen. F. necrophorum is a causative agent of liver abscesses in grain-fed
    cattle, and antibiotics are currently added to feed to prevent its growth and
    limit abscess occurrence. However, in-feed antibiotics promote the proliferation
    of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and can cause undesirable off-target effects
    to the rumen microbiome. This research seeks to develop broad host-range (polyvalent)
    bacteriophages as an economical means of controlling cattle pathogens. Polyvalent
    bacteriophages will be isolated using specialized methods that select for those
    with a predetermined host-range based on rumen microbial composition. Each bacteriophage
    will then be characterized and tested for efficacy within a bioreactor operated
    to simulate the cattle rumen. Bacteriophage cocktails will be formulated and tested
    for their ability to minimize the development of bacteriophage resistance. The
    expected outcome of the proposed research is a library of polyvalent bacteriophages
    that can effectively control F. necrophorum under rumen-like conditions, and which
    will be further tested in animal studies.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving the quality of general and task lighting and reducing the amount of wasted light, thus reducing energy consumption. Solid state lighting has caused a paradigm shift in the lighting industry. However, the rapid growth of the LED has surpassed our understanding of its effects on human health and productivity, as well as the environment. Developing systems that put light only where it is needed can reduce energy consumption and improve well-being by eliminating glare and wasted light. Full control over where artificial lights shine may also reduce the disruption of natural ecosystems and agriculture caused by light pollution.? Unfortunately, a compact and low-cost solution to spatially controllable illumination is not available. Should one be brought to market, the industry could be tailored to meet the needs of each street lamp, each office worker and the entertainment industry among others. The ubiquitous nature of artificial illumination provides a unique commercial opportunity with multiple market segments for growth potential.

    The proposed project will focus on a microsystems solution to steerable lighting using a low-power, low-cost, silicon-based mirror less than 1 mm in diameter. The mirror is capable of real-time adjustments that will steer incident light with significant angular range. It is controlled using digital electronics and easily combined with traditional smart home electronics. The objective of the research is to measure the optical output of varying system setups and optical components to determine what optics are necessary for proper light output shape, uniformity, and color temperature. The project will rely heavily on a combination of test measurements and simulations to cycle through experiments rapidly and efficiently in order to converge on a manufacturing plan.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable electrification of remote oil & gas processes to reduce methane emissions, improve on-site safety, and provide leak-detection and monitoring capabilities. This will be achieved by developing a robust, efficient, small-scale power generator capable of converting on-site fuel to electricity. Beyond the entry opportunity in the oil & gas sector, this technology has other applications in large markets such as residential and commercial power generation and heating, transportation, and military. For example, our proposed generators would allow consumers in moderate/cold climates to efficiently match their time-dependent heating and electrical demands using natural gas (accessible to 70 million households). For a typical household in those regions, we estimate a 45% reduction in primary energy use and CO2 emissions by deploying our generators. The energy reduction translates to an annual savings of about $650 per household. Widespread deployment of our technology would grow the domestic natural gas economy, strengthen the US technological lead in semiconductor manufacturing, and facilitate renewables by providing a dispatchable supply.?

    The proposed project will investigate the fundamental heat-to-electric conversion process and address key issues around the stability and robustness of the technology, through a synergistic effort to develop generators capable of high performance and a manufacturing process to reduce cost. The project will focus on device optimization and durability, and process repeatability. This involves the fabrication and integration of multiple frequency-selective components including a thermal emitter, optical filter, photovoltaic cell, and back surface reflector. Each component, as well as the integrated system, will undergo rigorous thermal testing to prove both resistance to elevated temperatures and temperature swings. Additionally, novel manufacturing techniques will be developed to enable cost-competitive devices relative to conventional generators. If the technical objectives are met, this project will demonstrate record-breaking performance for thermophotovoltaics and accelerate the commercialization of thermophotovoltaic devices in many different markets.?

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project include enabling the minimally invasive treatment of a large variety of conditions. This is expected to be achieved through the development of a steerable needle that can reach arbitrary positions in the human body that are not reachable by a straight needle from a simple needle hole. The long term impact of the proposed technology is in targeted delivery of medicine, or the removal of tissue such as biopsies, or treatment mechanisms such as ablation devices. An overarching goal of the proposed project is the availability of minimally invasive procedures that can replace more drastic surgery options. The development of this device has the potential to also save lives, treating what otherwise would be inoperable conditions due to the location of tumors blocked by sensitive organs or bones.


    The proposed project, if successful, will lead to demonstrating the application of a device that utilizes the buckling behavior of semi-curved beams to controllably alter the stiffness in a needle for cancer treatment and measure its efficacy in terms of the advantages over straight needles. The objectives of this research include: developing a prototype and match to surgeon use cases (interventional radiologist) and testing and characterizing the steerability performance while delivering the medical payload. Specifically, it is expected that the first therapeutic application of this technology will be microwave ablation of cancer tumors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the first time commercial development of a copper cable which can transmit and store energy. Currently, copper cables are used for transmitting electricity. Adding energy storage capability to these cables is transformative and has the potential to be employed in a myriad of electrical and electronic applications. Making these cables into spools of wires and custom sliced into a certain length to achieve a required capacitance will be very attractive to commercial applications. The proposed study enables to understand how energy transmission and storage can be simultaneously performed without mutual interference. These cables can find niche applications in the automotive, energy, defense, and IT industries. Moreover, when made into thin wires, it can be weaved into a matrix which can be used to charge wearable devices. For example, currently, a soldier carries about 30-40 pounds of battery for a three-day mission. However, if energy storage devices like the one proposed here can be made into an advanced textile form and can be worn as a uniform, the weight currently carried by the soldiers can be considerably reduced. A cable energy storage device developed can also be beneficial for storing energy for clean-energy technologies such as wind and solar.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project fills the gap of a cable-type capacitor which saves space and fits well with electrical and electronic devices. The objective of this proposal is to use nanotechnology-based fabrication techniques to grow nanowhiskers with a high surface area on a copper cable to make cable-type capacitors. These nanostructures considerably enhance the surface area necessary for the storage of electrical charges. Since nanostructures are developed only on the outside of the electrical cable to store energy, the inner part of the cable can still be used for electrical transmission. The focus of the proposed research is to develop the processes which can be used to make these nanostructured electrodes into a cable capacitor. The fabrication techniques for growing nanostructures will be so designed that making long lengths of the cables are feasible. The performance of the cable-based capacitors will be tested in terms of capacitance, cycle life, voltage output, etc. In addition, the flexibility of the cable will be tested at different bend-angles to evaluate its applications in flexible energy storage applications.

    This SBIR Phase I project will study the development of a digitally configurable shape around which a shoe can be created. The results of this project will enable the mass-customization of shoes so they can precisely fit the feet of the individuals who wear them. Properly fitting shoes are intended to improve the quality of life of customers through reduced pain and improved musculoskeletal health. This development in shoe-making technology is of broad interest to the population of the United States, but particularly important to women, who often suffer from physical deformities and injuries caused by ill-fitting shoes. The proposed innovation relies on mass-customization methods and flexible robotics technology. Its anticipated success will provide additional jobs in the shoe industry and related fields, and improve productivity nationwide through reduced healthcare costs.


    The strong technical innovation in this project will be the adaptation of granular jamming technology for use in programmable shape technology. The driving goal of the proposed project is to develop a last for use in the mass-customization of shoes that is capable of changing shape in response to a digital representation of the customer's foot shape. After changing shape, it will lock into a rigid but smooth form appropriate for use in traditional shoe manufacturing methods. The scope of the research will cover the development of the last in a manner appropriate for use in manufacturing conditions (in terms of both physical and temperature durability) and the creation and implementation of algorithms for transforming foot shape data into an appropriately fitting shoe shape and for transforming a standard shoe pattern onto an arbitrary foot shape. Iterative design practices and just-in-time manufacturing techniques will facilitate the development of this new technology and manufacturing methodology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a substantial reduction of leakage in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. HDPE is a type of plastic commonly used for water, oil, and gas distribution pipe systems. Billions of gallons of treated water are lost daily across the US due to leaking pipes, resulting in massive revenue loss, environmental and property damage, and energy waste. Furthermore, millions of metric tons of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, escape every year into the atmosphere through leaking pipes. Most leaks occur at pipe joints and by wirelessly monitoring each joint for leaks, as a part of a smart infrastructure network, major leak reduction can be achieved. The commercial impact of the project is extensive, as smart infrastructure networks are increasingly being implemented and expanded, sensor and wireless communication technology has advanced significantly in recent years, and the rate of piping infrastructure installations, replacements, and repairs are accelerating across the US and globally.

    The proposed project aims to demonstrate a prototype capable of detecting a leak in electrofusion joints and wirelessly communicate the leak to an external network. Such joint monitoring system is highly desirable as pipe leaks can go undetected for an extended period of time. Moreover, once detected, leaks can be difficult and expensive to locate, especially as pipes are commonly buried underground or situated at hard-to-reach or remote locations. The challenge that comes with this  is to provide a reliable local power source for the sensing unit that can be on standby for up to 50 years. A second challenge is to generate a signal, powered by the local power source, that can be transmitted to the surface and notify a leak to an external signal receiver. A water-activated battery combined with a radio-frequency identification (RFID) transmitter will be developed for this purpose. RFID technology is extensively used in a broad range of industries due to its low-cost and good reliability . This technology is, therefore, an excellent candidate for providing an affordable joint leak detection system.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will study how communications feedback loops effect online learning, especially in group settings. The explosion of online learning experiences in recent years, in which many courses fail to engage learners or help them achieve their academic and professional goals, has put focus on the problem of engagement. Interest in online learning remains high, as it presents an opportunity to broaden the reach of institutions and companies, but success rates in broadly available learning experiences are low. Built upon foundational research in computational social science, the project will use specialized video and text chat tools to collect data from groups engaged in synchronous online learning, analyze and categorize patterns of communication, and give feedback to students to help them have better, more successful experiences online. In keeping with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare, the project applies emerging innovations in artificial intelligence to the problem of delivering high-quality learning at scale. While most applications focus on individual learners and creating new personalized educational pathways, this project highlights the importance of collective learning and the power of peer engagement to help all members of a learning community reach their goals together.


    This project introduces several innovations in data capture and analytics, as well as feedback to learners while they are collaborating online. While many students use online collaboration tools such as discussion boards, chat, and video, this project focuses on providing interventions to change behavior in real-time. During conversations, such as those happening when people brainstorm to solve a problem or work on shared assignments, certain vocal patterns indicate engagement, reveal unstated agreements and discords, and expose individual biases. Using deep learning and data modeling, real-time feedback about conversational dominance is generated and shown to learners while they are speaking. The project further explores the effect of machine-generated insights about what happened during the collaboration, and makes recommendations about behavior modifications, based on predictive models. For more nuanced insights, these data are paired with facial-gestural data, such as nodding or raising one?s eyebrows. Together, these innovations combine data that has never been collected at scale before with social science data models uniquely applied to online learning. The goal of the research project is to prove that insights like these have a net positive effect on learning outcomes and raise the level of satisfaction with online learning experiences that incorporate these tools.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on establishing full-scale production parameters, quality control procedures, operational testing and commercialization of cutting-edge compartmentalized vacuum composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in cold chain shipping, storage, building insulation, automobiles, aerospace and other advanced markets. The first application is in the cold chain shipping industry, for packaging and storage of temperature sensitive materials. A new generation of thin (less than 1"), light weight, highly insulated (R value 25-30), durable, and long service life boxes will meet a critical need in this area. Temperature-sensitive products such as vaccines, blood, organs, and diagnostic specimens are shipped using insulated containers, and the new materials to be developed will permit longer shipping duration, higher impact resistance, and re-usability. The cold chain shipping market includes the Red Cross, blood banks, pharmacies, clinical trial shippers, diagnostic centers, life science material providers and whole sale distributors. The annual United States market potential in life sciences packaging is estimated at $291 million.  The resulting materials also have significant potential for uses in permanent and temporary structures, and in a variety of transportation applications.

    Successful completion of the Phase I work has resulted in cost-effective (an order of magnitude lower expected cost), stronger (ten times the impact resistance of Styrofoam), lightweight, thin (less than 1"), highly-insulating (R 16-22), compartmentalized vacuum composite materials.  An exclusive machining capability was also demonstrated, whereby vacuum composites can be cut and sized on-site without degradation in thermal performance, an issue which affects current vacuum insulation panels (VIPs).  Optimization of the developed composites to achieve targeted insulation rating, cost, and service life characteristics will be conducted during Phase II. Thermal performance, mechanical characteristics and operational performance will be evaluated for their application in cold chain shipping and in building/structural insulation. The team will also validate boxes fabricated using these materials in cold chain shipping to verify safe transportation of blood products, organs, and/or pharmaceuticals.  Based on the Phase II work, it is anticipated that these materials will be poised to replace petroleum-based foam materials and vacuum insulation panels as a high-performance and economical solution in these markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to deliver a bio-based and functionally improved optical polymer that can be made into a lens. The lens product has commercial applications in rapidly growing mass-markets like Prescription eyewear that is growing significantly due to onslaught of myopia. Using scientific data, this proposal demonstrates an improved commercial product for myopia when compared to Polycarbonate, the most popular eyewear material in US. Work proposed in Phase II focuses on development of the polymer at large scale and its conversion to lenses using a lower-cost, one-step molding process that can also reduce current industry wastages by as much as an estimated 90%. For establishing suitability of the product towards commercial applications, the Phase II goals include product testing in lab as well as with real subjects to generate marketable data.  Finished prescription lenses are a ~$30 billion plus market, with ~70% of lens sales serving myopic patients, who will see a tremendous benefit from using our ultra-clear lens. Broader impact of this technology proposal is to make eyeglasses exponentially more affordable in contrast to today's high costs. Price controls exerted by market monopolies like Luxottica and Essilor on finished lenses pose a huge barrier to base of pyramid markets. Our easy-to-make lens technology simplifies the eyewear supply chain for benefit of these unconventional markets and can lower costs dramatically for billions of people around the world, who are separated by a pair of glasses from otherwise blindness.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to leverage properties of sugars to build an optically clear, transparent polymer of good refractive index, low dispersion and low density. In commercial applications of this polymer as a prescription lens, it thus represents a state-of-the-art product that combines the best properties of various incumbent eyewear materials into one.  A key intellectual merit of this SBIR project is to achieve a plastic with optical properties similar to glass, a gold standard in optical materials. Our chemistry platform is 90% bio-based, a unique value proposition in prescription lens industry, where use of extremely toxic and hazardous chemicals is common. Phase I work has also led to the development of a novel route of manufacturing lenses which can lower cost barriers for setting up optical labs, expedite the process for making prescription lenses and cut wastages in current prescription industry. In Phase II, our goal is to methodically develop the process for making lenses using Novol's polymers and obtain data to translate the proposed technology to a commercially preferred lens product with special benefits to myopic patients.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to industry stakeholders holding financial
    interests that are impacted by climate change. Climate change has a scientifically
    evident impact on the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme weather events.
    It has become imperative for organizations in all sectors to gain a clear understanding
    of the impacts of climate change on their business so as to inform strategic planning
    and risk management strategies. Those in the risk transfer industry, in particular
    reinsurance companies, are the most likely early adopters given their technical
    sophistication and their increasing and acute awareness of the financial impacts
    climate change now has on their bottom line. Thus, the company's goal is to penetrate
    the reinsurance industry as an entry point to the more broadly defined risk transfer
    industry. Subsequently, the company will utilize the platform to address problems
    in agricultural investment, real estate investment, and energy planning - all
    sectors that will be adversely impacted by climate change in specific, well-defined
    ways. The adaptation in each of these sectors is vital to the well-being and prosperity
    of the ultimate stakeholder: the American taxpayer. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project aims to harness industry knowledge and expand on the
    technical work conducted during the company's Phase I project, with the objective
    of building a modular software platform generalizable to multiple key climate
    change hazards and extensible to other strategically identified sectors. The knowledge
    gathered via customer discovery interviews in Phase I will serve as a guide for
    product development. The technical work completed in Phase I, in particular extreme
    precipitation modeling under climate change and its application to the risk transfer
    sector, will serve as a foundation for expansion into the modeling of additional
    hazards. There are currently no tools available that integrate climate change
    informatics into risk management at scale. The company aims to address this problem
    through the translation of physics-guided statistical modeling to a commercial
    software platform. Upon conclusion of the Phase II project, the company expects
    to have a completed product that will house data on additional hazards exacerbated
    by climate change, with applications in the agriculture, commercial real estate,
    and the energy sectors. The company will show product value through sector-tailored
    software demonstrations and case studies that demonstrate return on investment
    to be realized by using this platform.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project comes from addressing the thermal challenges brought about by the significant increase in transistor density that semiconductors have experienced over the past few decades. This trend has enabled many advancements ranging from high performance servers to Internet of Things devices. Still, with every advance in chip technology, the difficulty of chip cooling continues to increase. Three major thermal interface material (TIM) market segments exist: polymer composites, metallic materials and phase-change materials. Commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will create a fourth market segment that will supplant existing TIMs, initially in the chip testing market and eventually extending into servers, high performance computing and Internet of Things devices. CNT researchers and small businesses have made little progress towards a commercial TIM product. Among other factors, this failure is driven by poor positioning in the crowded low-cost TIM space, which is currently dominated by thermal greases and pads. Progress towards a viable solution lies in the strategic alignment of product features with industry pain points. This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a means to scale the ability to produce CNT based TIMs as well as to further improve their performance.

    The technical objectives of this SBIR Phase II project are to: 1) scale up of the CNT TIM manufacturing process to achieve a production capacity of 200,000 sq. in of product annually and to 2) enhance the conductivity of the CNT array by a factor of 3x or more to facilitate entry into the TIM1 and TIM2 market. This project will ultimately develop processes that will translate into achieving production scale CNT based thermal interface materials for the first time in the world. Scale up will be achieved through a combination of physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition processes developed on tools designed specifically for CNT production. In Phase I of this research effort, two commercial products aimed at the semiconductor chip testing market were developed and validated through collaboration with leading chip manufacturers. In addition to the chip testing market segment, in Phase II products will be developed for entry into the TIM1 and Internet of Things markets.

- abstractText: "Diesel engines remain critical to global economies, but are under
    threat from increasingly-stringent emissions regulations. Many alternatives, like
    spark-ignition and electric vehicles, sacrifice some of the performance or range
    benefits of Diesel-style operation. This creates a market need for technologies
    that can maintain Diesel engine performance while remaining decoupled from the
    dirty emissions of Diesel fuel. This proposal centers on the development of the
    ?ClearFlame Combustion System? (CFCS): a novel combustion process that enables
    Diesel-style engines to combust low-carbon alternative fuels like ethanol and
    methanol without sacrificing the power possible with traditional Diesel combustion.
    Further, the sootless nature of alternative fuels such as methanol and ethanol
    obviates the need for a Diesel particulate filter, and enables stoichiometric
    air-fuel ratios to eliminate the need for selective catalytic reduction of NOx
    (smog). The engine technology has the potential to alter the dynamics of any market
    dominated by Diesel engines (including heavy-duty transportation, agriculture,
    rail, and power generation) and can be licensed to, or jointly developed with,
    OEMs for simple integration into their existing product lines. Phase I results
    have shown a 30% increase in engine torque at increased efficiency, while engine-out
    soot emissions are more than 100x lower than that of Diesel engines, falling under
    the 2010 EPA regulation limit without aftertreatment. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of the CFCS. The
    Phase I results showed that three critical CFCS subsystems?engine insulation,
    alcohol direct injection, and a combustion chamber optimized for stoichiometric
    combustion with exhaust gas load control?could be developed and integrated to
    achieve a previously unattainable combination of strong performance and low emissions.
    This Phase II effort will further advance these key components and demonstrate
    the benefits of the CFCS on a commercial engine platform, using CFD modeling and
    engine experiments to show the advantages of the CFCS compared to the Diesel baseline.
    The goal is to show how the CFCS enables a multi-cylinder heavy-duty engine to
    simultaneously improve power density by 30% at no loss of efficiency, while also
    achieving sootless stoichiometric exhaust conditions that are compatible with
    low-cost and highly-effective three-way catalysis (the same system that enables
    gasoline and natural gas engines to be much cleaner than Diesel). A Phase II prototype
    demonstration would realize a longtime industry goal of integrating three-way
    catalysis with a Diesel-style engine, allowing Diesel-style engines to achieve
    the emissions profile of the cleanest alternatives (like natural gas).\n\nThis

    and more successful and cost-effective clinical trials, bring drugs to market
    more rapidly.  The goal is identification of disease subtypes and patient subgroups,
    a prerequisite to the ability to distinguish between patients who are in danger
    and need the most aggressive treatments, and those who are less suited to treatment
    because they will never progress or recur or they will develop resistance. Currently,
    70% of drugs entering Phase III clinical trials fail, leading to a loss of more
    than $1 trillion per year. This may be avoided by refining trial inclusion criteria
    and administering the drug only to the patients most likely to respond. The technology
    is designed to identify patient subgroups most likely to respond or not respond
    to a given treatment. This technology also may reduce the cost of prophylactic
    clinical trials by reducing the number of subjects and/or duration necessary to
    achieve sufficient power. The technology will significantly reduce drug development

    to develop a novel analysis method and software package that is able to identify

    Many drug candidates fail and many patients receive inappropriate treatment because
    of the current inability to distinguish between subgroups of patients (respondents

    The current unmet challenge is to discover the molecular subtypes of disease and
    subgroups of patients. Attempts to achieve this based solely on gene expression
    signatures have been undertaken but yielded only modest success (very few gene
    expression tests are FDA-approved to date). The technology proposed here may be
    used to discover clinically relevant disease subtypes by integrating multiple
    types of high-throughput data. In addition, the Phase I results obtained on real
    patient data demonstrated that the technology is able to distinguish between more
    and less aggressive types of cancer based on their molecular profiles alone. This

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes reducing emission of Diesel engines' toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) in challengingly low temperature exhaust operations, while eliminating damaging urea deposits saving warranty costs for vehicle manufacturers, saving fuel, reducing greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O as well as particulate matter, while potentially enabling downsizing the complex and costly diesel emission control systems. The novel technology developed in this SBIR project may be configured for retrofitting existing diesel platforms.  Nitrogen oxides pose risks to human respiratory and pulmonary systems, are associated with forming ground level ozone, photochemical oxidants, acid rain and fine particles, amongst a variety of their detriments, and their emission is therefore regulated. Our concept, when successful, will therefore make available a broad value proposition to the society, the environment and to the mobility industry. Finally, the insights developed into its gas phase reactions may have applications in other branches of science and technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to resolve a currently unmet need in mitigating emission of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engines, especially in low exhaust temperatures such as when the vehicle operates in stop-and-go, in local delivery or when idles its engine. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, easy-to-fit and simple-to-integrate novel technology enabling low temperature Diesel NOx reduction. Continuing our successful Phase I research results, in this Phase II project more advanced prototypes will be developed and tested in low-temperature exhaust conditions, demonstrating rapid reduction of NOx on a commercially-available Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst, while evaluating the impact on lowering greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O.  High fidelity computer simulations will be heavily utilized to further our understanding of underlying mechanisms such as the gas-phase reactions as well as to accelerate the development path. The project outcome is expected to alleviate a remaining challenge in Diesel emission control and to be rapidly welcome by the Diesel engine and vehicle industry.

  title: 'SBIR Phase II:  Novel Urea Mixer to Enable Low Temperature Reduction of
    Diesel Exhaust Nitrogen Compounds'
- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    enable video-rate three-dimensional (3D) imaging within two-photon microscopes
    (2PMs) by developing novel deformable membrane mirror (DMM) technology for fast,
    precise focus control. As a subset of laser scanning microscopes (LSMs), 2PMs
    achieve very high spatial resolution by using a focused, high-power laser beam
    to excite fluorescence via the simultaneous absorption of two low-energy infrared
    photons to stimulate emission in the visible spectrum. Because of the increased
    resolution, and increased penetration of infrared light into tissue compared with
    other LSM methods, 2PMs have become widely accepted for use in the life sciences,
    specifically for neuroscience. The DMM technology developed for this project will
    address the $165 million 2PM market by delivering an electrically tunable optic
    capable of simultaneously controlling focus and aberrations while operating an
    order of magnitude faster than competitive technologies. The 3D imaging capabilities
    enabled by this technology will propel new research in the field of neuroscience
    aimed at solving widespread, chronic medical problems like stroke and Alzheimer's
    disease. Once the 2PM entry market is addressed, this technology will be refined
    to address the much larger $5.8 billion 3D laser printing market. \n\nDuring the
    Phase I project, new mirror coatings were developed to handle the high-power lasers
    used in 2PMs. With the core DMM technology in place, this Phase II project is
    aimed primarily at control of mirror actuation and shape for reliable use in 2PMs.
    The first objective of this Phase II project will develop electronics for robust
    control of mirror actuation and shape. Objective two will center on refining the
    core DMM technology and fabrication methods to enable position sensing of the
    membrane and improve mirror stroke to satisfy customers in 2PM markets. The final
    objective will involve the creation of optical and mechanical assemblies and modules
    for incorporating the DMM technology into key microscopes. The result of this
    Phase II will be a market-ready DMM product with active focus control to address
    the growing 2PM market.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
    been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    address the design, prototype and testing of a modular tension control device
    for individual tension regulation in the composite manufacturing sector. Composites
    are increasingly used in mission critical applications where the material and
    the product must perform reliably, while at the same time improving productivity,
    increasing product quality and lowering cost. By precisely and consistently controlling
    tension, there are fewer voids, skips or uneven tows, resulting in a higher quality
    product. This is particularly important when safety is dependent on the structural
    integrity of the materials. Overall, composite applications are greener and have
    a positive environmental impact. Comparably priced but safer automobiles from
    composites will be lighter and consume less fuel. Composites further reduce reliance
    on fossil fuels, as they are the building blocks to harness renewable energy.
    Wind blades, solar panels and underwater turbines are all made from composites.
    This is a rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar market, and the projected share
    of the targeted tension control market is in the range of $200 million, growing
    equally fast, if not faster. \n\nThis project will solve a problem that has plagued
    the composites industry since its inception. Tension control is especially difficult
    (and yet very important in the composites industry), as multiple materials with
    different tear strengths and varying elasticity are combined to make stronger
    products. Lack of cost effective tension control has, up to this point, limited
    the speed and quality of finished products. Phase II objectives are to prototype
    and develop the manufacturing process for the Modular Tensioning Cartridge. The
    Phase II Objectives are: 1) Control package design - the goal is to create a central
    base station to provide power, communications and a central interface for the
    use of multiple Modular Tensioning Cartridge units; 2) Finalization - all successfully
    tested components must be assembled into a singular industrial grade prototype
    unit and then tested; 3) Product release - upon final prototype testing, field
    trials will be conducted to validate and finalize technology leading to full production.
    In phase I, feasibility of the individual components to meet performance requirements
    was successfully demonstrated. In Phase II, prototype units will be developed
    and tested refining the design to meet the performance expectations of the customers.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project will be to develop a platform technology for detecting
    autoantibody markers for research and clinical diagnostics. Precision medicine
    requires the development of more powerful bioanalytic technologies to diagnose
    disease and direct targeted therapies. This platform uses a ligation-based DNA
    barcoding technology for improved antibody detection with increased analytical
    sensitivity and multiplex power to detect more at the most clinically useful time.
    Additionally, as a solution-phase assay, it is able to detect numerous clinically-relevant
    autoantibodies that are refractory to common techniques like ELISA.  This platform
    has the potential to accelerate the development of lifesaving diagnostics across
    a broad spectrum of human diseases. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    Phase II project aims to develop the first solution-phase, ultrasensitive and
    multiplex antibody assay platform for the early detection, monitoring and treatment
    of human diseases. The Antibody Detection by Agglutination-PCR (ADAP) platform
    represents a major advancement in multiplex immunoassay testing. Many current
    multiplex technologies, such as microarrays and bead-based arrays, scale poorly
    due to cross-analyte interference, and lack the analytical sensitivity to detect
    crippling diseases at the most favorable time.  The Phase I results showed the
    expanded and validated ADAP technology for the ultrasensitive and multiplex detection
    of antibody biomarkers. The Phase II objectives are: 1) Validation of the multiplex
    ADAP assay for clinical diagnostics serving autoimmune connective tissue diseases,
    thyroid disorders and celiac diseases; 2) High-throughput automation of multiplex
    ADAP assay technology for clinical diagnostics; 3) Manufacturing of assay reagents
    and establishment of quality control standards; and 4) Demonstration of the applicability
    of multiplex ADAP for a broader set of antibodies. The intellectual merit of this
    project resides in the achievement of 10,000x increased sensitivity, and 20-30%
    increased specificity at multiplex while having the option to use existing PCR
    reader platforms to help keep lab capital costs low.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    This SBIR Phase II project will fully develop and market a digital language tool previously found effective in helping non-native English speakers acquire language skills. It was found in SBIR Phase I that students using the tool improved their test scores both absolutely and relative to their peers. Spanish-speaking students learned more effectively when given native-language educational tools in multiple subjects. Competing educational tools are not designed to help those who are natively fluent in Spanish transfer their skills to a new language. Consequently, more than 40% of non-native speakers drop out. If successful, this project will bring to a wider market an existing educational product (created by a small, minority-owned business and already in use nationwide), and improve the educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands of non-native English-speaking students in both language arts and the scientific disciplines core to the National Science Foundation?s mission. Moreover, because schools face significant financial pressure to improve student achievement and because the product is competitively priced, it will be shown to be commercially viable, and a plan will be developed to expand the market for the tool outside of the state of California where it was initially studied.


    An expanding body of research has shown that language learners perform better on standardized tests when they can transfer their ability in another language (Spanish) to the acquisition of English. However, existing tools have not yet met this market need and focus instead on English-only instruction optimized for students who already speak natively. This project proposes to fully develop and market an existing language-acquisition platform found to be effective during pilot research in a large California school. SBIR Phase II research will address outstanding hypotheses suggested by Phase I results, and determine whether the tool can be easily adopted by stakeholders. Specifically, the impact of assignments chosen by teachers will be disambiguated from the use of the tool more generally, and the impact of English-only versus bilingual scaffolding will be studied in more detail to tailor the product to individual use cases. During Phase II, the product will also be integrated with existing academic systems and analytical software, and competitive per-seat pricing will be developed such that it can be marketed first within California and then nationwide by a network of resellers. A successful product will be measured by its effectiveness in closing the gap between native and non-native English speakers, at scale.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to facilitate understanding of cellular diversity in tumors, a phenomenon that contributes to acquired drug resistance. Quantifying and understanding this diversity may help predict a patient?s response to certain drugs which would allow the selection of ideal drug combinations for an individual patient?s tumor, thus enabling personalized medicine. This Phase II project will provide drug developers and researchers with a tool that can quantify diversity by correlating genetic and spatial information from tumors, providing crucial information about tumor composition that is currently missing today. This project will translate the technology into an efficient, high-throughput workflow that will enable commercialization with drug developers, researchers, and reference laboratories, generating both income and multiple job opportunities. The commercialization of this innovation will significantly impact scientific, corporate, and patient communities. Researchers will have a new tool improving drug development for cancer and other diseases, including Alzheimer?s and diabetes. Payers, such as insurance companies and the government, will save costs by eliminating unnecessary spending on treatments for patients who will not respond. Most importantly, patients will have broader access to personalized medicine through new treatments and screening methods that can help determine the optimum drug combinations for them.

    A single tumor contains multiple populations of cells that each have unique mutations, and it is necessary to understand the location and genetic differences of these cells in order to provide effective combination therapies that will not result in overall treatment failure or relapse. This Phase II project aims to provide drug developers, researchers, and physicians with a tool to correlate genetic and spatial information about individual tumors. Using a proprietary microfluidic device adhered to a standard microscope slide and tissue biopsy, incorporated with a laser-coupled microscope, this tool is capable of providing information that it is not possible to obtain from any other method today. Building upon the feasibility established during the Phase I project, Phase II will involve performing NGS to demonstrate the instrument?s usefulness in providing data for clinical research and biomarker discovery. It will also involve building a fully integrated prototype instrument with features that increase automation and throughput to make the technology economically feasible for commercialization. These developments will showcase the instrument?s value to customers as well as enable the commercial launch of a service.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in promoting clean energy technologies. More than half of the United States? greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation and electricity production. Lithium-ion batteries are a promising technology to facilitate the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable power generation that drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, the high cost of lithium-ion batteries threatens the commercial viability of clean technologies. This Phase II project will develop manufacturing process technologies that reduce the capital and operating costs of the most expensive step in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Low-cost batteries will push electric vehicles towards widespread commercial adoption. Electrification of mass-transit buses will improve urban air quality, especially for the low-income population located near bus depots. Large-scale battery systems enabled by low-cost batteries will turn renewable power generation such as solar and wind from periodic energy sources into on-demand energy sources to alleviate our dependence on fossil-fuels. This Phase II project will help lithium-ion batteries become a key technology in the successful departure from oil dependence, combat of climate change, and the United States? energy security.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for deeper understanding of the fundamental science behind the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. SEI layer quality is a key determinant of long-term battery reliability, performance, and safety, but the underlying electrochemistry that governs SEI composition and evolution remains poorly understood. This Phase II project will develop novel, in-situ diagnostics to directly measure the evolution, performance, and characteristics of the SEI layer as it is formed during lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Deeper insight into the complex morphology of the SEI layer will advance much-needed industry knowledge of battery performance, quality, and longevity. Additionally, there is a sizeable body of work in modeling the degradation of batteries throughout their lifecycle. With improved cell-level traceability, the manufacturing insights enabled by this Phase II project will expand the current understanding of the ?ideal battery? at the beginning of life and complement ongoing work on how batteries degrade over time. This insight opens the door for quality control in battery manufacturing based on more direct quality metrics such as longevity and reliability rather than indirect metrics such as beginning of life capacity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to de-risk the volume manufacturability and reliability of thin crystalline power MOSFETs fabricated with a novel exfoliation technology demonstrated in Phase 1.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable lower cost and better performance for power devices in switching or transferring electricity under varying power requirements across the voltage spectrum in a variety of applications ranging from consumer, to communications, automotive and industrial applications.  In all of these applications, the ON resistance of the power MOSFET and IGBTs can be reduced and the switching speed and performance further improved by reducing the device thickness.  Additionally, in consumer and mobile applications, reducing the form factor of the power MOSFET devices can enable slimmer and lighter products.  A significant broader impact of this technology will be the reduction of expensive and environmentally hazardous waste treatment processes associated with wafer grinding technology used in the power MOSFET industry.  While the power MOSFETs developed using this technology can have broad commercial and societal impact, the use of this thin crystalline technology can have even broader impact across all modern semiconductor devices such as LED, PV, flexible CMOS and passive devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses challenges to further scaling of Power MOSFETs which are one of the key building blocks of the electronic revolution over the last few decades. While the feature size of transistors has been constantly shrinking, the substrate thickness has been increasing. These substrates are currently mechanically thinned to minimize the negative impact of this increased thickness on performance and form-factor. There are significant challenges to continue this trend and the thin crystalline technology and device architecture proposed here can enable continued scaling of device metrics over the next decade with favorable cost structures.  During phase I, functional power MOSFETs were demonstrated with this thin crystalline technology to establish the feasibility of this technology for power devices. This phase II effort will focus on the following specific technical challenges to bring it to market. (1) Develop power MOSFETs with improved switching characteristics using the thin crystalline technology (2) High voltage high current characterization of the thin crystalline power MOSFETs (3) Process yield and reliability characterization of package thin crystalline power MOSFET parts and (4) Convert existing process line to use thin crystalline exfoliation technology in high volume manufacturing flow.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project includes tremendous commercial potential, societal benefits, and scientific advances. Conventional superabsorbent polymers (SAP) are based on polyacrylates or polyacrylamides derived from petroleum feedstock. They are widely used in the absorbent cores of hygiene products, with disposable diapers representing approximately 85% of the global SAP market of $6B. Increasing consumer and supply chain demand for more natural, sustainable materials and products has driven the development of eco-friendly / natural labeled absorbent hygiene products (AHP). Eco-friendly diaper products currently make up about 3% of the global market and are experiencing strong growth at 10-15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This project will lead to the commercialization of a low-cost high-performance biobased SAP, offering significant environmental benefits as a more sustainable, eco-friendly alternative to petrobased SAP. This project could also generate positive economic impacts on domestic agriculture by creating new demand for bio-feedstocks such as waste glycerol. Finally, this project advances the scientific and technological state-of-the-art by developing a new bioprocess based on microbial co-cultures that could be extended to render more efficient, cost-effective routes for producing other biobased fuels and chemicals.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a new biological route, based on microbial co-cultures, for cost-effective production of gamma-polyglutamic acid (PGA) and to commercialize cross-linked PGA SAP for AHP applications. In Phase I of this project, a microbial co-culture process was developed for efficient production of PGA via in-situ precursor production (ISPP) from low-cost bio-feedstocks. materials. Building on promising results in Phase I, further R&D will aim to reach pilot-scale production by the end of Phase II. Three specific technical objectives will be pursued: Objective 1: Strain engineering and bioprocess optimization to develop an ISPP fermentation process with commercially viable performance metrics. Objective 2: Optimization of downstream purification, SAP cross-linking, and finishing to produce a high performance finished PGA SAP product. Objective 3: Pilot-scale process demonstration to produce commercial quantities of PGA SAP for large scale customer/partner trials. This R&D plan will lead to transformative technological outcomes. The proposed process based on microbial co-cultures represents a distinct shift from the conventional paradigm of utilizing single-species monocultures for bioprocessing and offers substantial cost-savings. The engineering and process development strategies developed during this project will be transferrable for a broad range of other co-culture bioprocessing applications.

    This Phase II project aims to help address the achievement gap for English Learners, who consistently average 21% below native English speakers on reading scale scores starting in 4th grade and are twice as likely to drop out of school. Eighty percent of teachers believe that materials for English Learners are sub-standard, which contributes to this gap. The project provides an online crowd-authoring and sharing platform that gives K-6 language teachers the tools to meet their unique instructional needs on demand. It is the first and only platform to enable practicing teachers to rapidly build digital language lessons and interactive games that align to their specific requirements, without any technical know-how. The platform provides built-in rich media resources that adhere to best practices based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Any teacher may access these open educational resources at no cost, provided they make their own creations available for public reuse, revision and remixing. The project seeks to understand the dynamics of collaboration and quality assurance for interactive content at a massive scale. Crowd-authoring can invest educators with the power to transform language learning into a field that is highly responsive to the evolving needs of educators and learners.

    This Phase II project will pioneer mass customization of interactive games and media in the field of second language acquisition. The project aims for teachers to create 175,000 custom digital lessons and interactive games using media resources provided by the project. Phase II will develop four new types of games that improve language acquisition using audiovisual experimentation, realtime chat with artificial intelligences, and a new technology that transforms visuals and narratives composed by students into grammatically accurate text and audio. Phase II will integrate these innovations into a crowd-authoring and quality assurance system capable of scaling to 100,000 new teacher-made learning objects per month. By giving language educators tools to rapidly create, share and customize content to meet their precise needs, the project seeks to significantly improve learning outcomes. Phase II will implement real-time formative assessment reports for teachers to evaluate student experiences and issues with the custom teacher-made interactive content. A controlled full-year, multi-site educational impact study will measure whether the project affects vocabulary acquisition, comprehension, grammar and sentence formation, and whether any skill gains transfer to other contexts. It will also reveal deep data insights about the process by which K-6 students acquire a second language.

    This Phase II project proposes to develop a computer science (CS) educational software that has the potential to inspire millions of U.S. K-12 students to learn computer programming.  This software will leverage the motivational power of a popular video game, to teach CS to students by teaching them to reprogram the video game itself.  The United States currently has a severe deficit of students pursuing CS.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that over 1 million computing job openings will go unfilled by U.S. workers by 2022.  By leveraging the power of a popular video game, the technology proposed in this Phase II project has the potential to expose millions of K-12 students to coding in the next 5 years.  The commercial impact of the underlying technology developed in this Phase II project does not stop at the over 100 million users who currently play the popular video game with which the current educational software integrates.  Because the underlying technology is transferable to any moddable (i.e. reprogrammable) video game, the technology has the potential to be used to teach CS with other popular titles from the rapidly growing video game industry.

    This Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a software product that is a web-based coding environment for novice programmers.  This software goes beyond the state-of-the-art technologies in this space (i.e., scratch.mit.edu) in several ways: 1) It uses automated tutoring techniques to customize the educational experiences for novices, 2) it facilitates writing programs that manipulate objects and terrain in a 3D environment, 3) it allows the novice user to reprogram a popular video game, 4) it has an in-browser, WebGL-based 3D runtime environment, 5) it supports both a novice-friendly visual programming language (Blockly) as well as a text-based language (JavaScript), 6) it leverages gamification techniques such as badges, points, and unlockable items, and 7) it supports multi-user, collaborative coding.  The objectives of this Phase II project concentrate on improving student experiences in order to increase customer retention and acquisition and to finish the development of a marketable product that will teach 5 million K-12 students in the next 5 years.  The first objective of this project involves developing and extending the browser-embedded game engine.  The second objective focuses on improving systems that match students with appropriate educational content and motivate students to continue learning.  Finally, the third objective involves implementing new systems that incentivize students to create and share with the community.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve our ability to fight infectious diseases that negatively impact agricultural yields and reduce the efficiency of global food production and distribution systems. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by leveraging the power of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to provide a pathogen identification and surveillance tool with demonstrated efficacy against known and unknown infectious agents. This platform is fast, sensitive, and cost-effective, and can be used for any animal sample to detect virtually all possible microbes even microbes that have never before been characterized. Hundreds of samples can be rapidly screened without relying upon known genetic/genomic data of microbes. The global molecular diagnostics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 14% from 2012 to 2017, with infectious disease testing being the leading application at 26% share, therefore the commercial opportunity of this project is vast.

    The proposed project follows up on the validation of the diagnostic platform (SBIR Phase I) and delves deeper into improving virus detection and genetic data generation. In addition, this proposal seeks to develop a basal informatics infrastructure that together with sample preparation improvements will be conducive of scalable, high-throughput analysis of several samples. Current diagnostic methods rely on what is already known about target microbe genetics, and provide limited information in the form of presence/absence of a known target sequence. The SBIR Phase I was instrumental to lowering the technical risks associated with a high-throughput unbiased pathogen detection platform based on DNA sequencing and Bayesian statistics. In the pursue of standardizing and validating our metagenomics pathogen identification platform, this project proposes to: 1) improve viral detection capabilities and accuracy, 2) develop new functionalities, and 3) incorporate Phase I and Phase II advances into an integrated in-house web-accessible interface.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a platform to rapidly design synthetic
    organisms to produce biochemicals, which will replace environmentally harmful,

    in this proposal will provide a competitive edge in the rapid engineering of synthetic
    organisms to produce biochemicals by fermentation that are currently produced
    from oil (reducing our CO2 emissions) or extracted from natural species (reducing
    our taxing load on existing ecosystems). This technology also has the potential
    to be used for the manufacture of drugs, and to engineer novel organisms to improve
    crop production and therefore help address the mounting challenges of providing
    food to a growing world population without tapping too much in Earth's resources.
    Commercially, the chemicals that will be enabled by application of the technology
    developed during the Phase I program open up billion dollar markets that are currently
    inaccessible to the chemical industry. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes
    to develop a platform that combines computational enzyme design with systems biology
    to create a fully integrated system for the design and testing of novel cell factories
    for the production of bulk and fine chemicals. During the Phase I project, the
    company, in collaboration with the University of Washington, has successfully
    developed a high-performance software code to rapidly design novel metabolic pathways
    to produce any target chemical from central metabolism. In Phase II, the company
    will further advance the concept by (1) developing a high-performance pathway
    prioritization module to estimate each designed pathway yield and impact on organism
    metabolism in the context of whole-genome models and (2) use the software platform
    to design libraries of pathways for the production of a variety of specialty chemical
    targets that are commercially valuable and not known to be produced by fermentation
    at scale. Then, (3) using an experimental screening setup, the DNA for all the
    proposed pathways will be assembled screened at high-throughput for detectable
    production of the target chemicals."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to directly and positively impact the speed of chemical analysis leading to cleaner and more advanced products. Technology resulting from the proposed activity will solve several pain points in the chemical analysis industry, including non-linearity, small dynamic range and variable, sometimes negligible, detector response. As a result, the technology will have broad use and lead to improved detection in pharmaceuticals, drug development, fuels, chemicals, renewables, foods, flavors, and academic and industrial research. Uniform response to carbon from flame ionization detection (FID) would be completely disruptive to the painstaking methods of calibration of known compounds and the guesswork associated with the quantification of unknowns. The benefits of this technology are expected to result in immense improvements in the speed and accuracy of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, thereby leading to better and safer products, with faster development times. Applied to the pharmaceutical and new drug development industry, this technology will have lasting impacts on the health and safety of society due to better and faster analyses available.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to deliver a carbon selective detector (CSD) to the global scientific market.  The CSD is a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  detector that produces a linear response to all organic compounds using a flame ionization detection (FID)  and a catalytic reactor. The key innovation is the novel development and use of a catalytic reactor to transform organic molecules and remove solvent in liquid chromatograph effluent streams. The FID, similar to those ubiquitous in gas chromatography (GC) systems, yields a universal response to organic compounds converted to methane with unparalleled linear range and robustness. The device will overcome limitations of the FID that have prevented previous use in HPLC by selectively removing solvents, oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide, reducing carbon dioxide to methane, and detecting the resulting methane with the FID.  The resulting product features, most notably a universal response to carbon, will provide pre-clinical pharmaceutical researchers with a tool that can quantify drugs and their by-products during screening, long before the process has been scaled up for the production of calibration standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a fast, efficient, and scalable cell engineering technology that is easily automated through integration with liquid handling robots.  Currently, there is a bottleneck in the process of cell engineering, especially in the engineering of cells for discovery of new therapeutics.  The field of delivery of genetic or other material to cells has not kept pace with advancements in genetic modification and high-throughput screening technologies.  The proposed platform will offer an alternative to the time-consuming and labor-intensive methods of transfection including lentiviral transduction and cuvette-based electroporation, which are difficult to automate.  Applications of cell engineering technology range from fundamental research in cell physiology to the discovery of new targets for cellular therapies.  The platform will allow scientists and clinicians to more rapidly and reliably engineer immune and other cells for discovery of new therapeutic targets and therapeutics.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project will be to develop a scalable, automated, non-viral cell engineering platform with the potential to operate up to 10,000 times faster than conventional electroporation using high-throughput liquid handling.  Using the core cell engineering technology developed in Phase I, the goal is to develop an automated protocol for gene transfection on a liquid handling robot compatible with 96 or 384 well plate technology.  The first objective is to demonstrate the manufacturability of cell engineering devices for high-throughput cell engineering. Preliminary work in this area has shown that these devices can be injection molded, thus reducing cost while increasing the potential for production at scale. In the Phase II project, injection molded prototypes of the cell engineering devices will be developed to prove manufacturability and determine the cost to manufacture at scale (millions of parts per year). Second, there are several supplemental systems that must be integrated with a liquid handling apparatus to enable the proposed high-throughput cell engineering. Supplemental systems include a power source and power distribution manifold that interacts with each sample of the 96 or 384 well array. In this project, these systems will be integrated with the cell engineering devices and automated liquid handling robot. Third, the integrated system will be used to generate a large library of primary human T cell variants as proof-of-concept to demonstrate the potential for high-throughput cell engineering for therapeutic target discovery.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the fact that it builds on the trend to make IT infrastructure consumable as a service and unlocks this potential for network functions. In deploying the Stateless Network Functions as a Service solution, cloud providers, enterprises, and internet service providers are able to launch network functions, such as firewalls and load balancers, on demand, and the Stateless platform automates the management of these functions.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever-increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project provides the research and development needed to realize the vision of a network function operating system.  Whereas the Phase I project established technical feasibility by demonstrating the technology that decouples network functions state from processing can be turned into a product and integrated into a production environment, the Phase II project will approach three new research directions that will support a complete platform.  (i) Network service chaining:  While not a new concept, it is one that has proven to be challenging with virtual appliances.  This project will add support to the Stateless platform to connect network functions into chains, elastically scale chains, and provide quality of service of the whole chain.  (ii) Observability:  This project will introduce the ability to abstract away the details when appropriate or peel away the layers of abstraction as needed, providing operators with a simple solution they have full control over.  (iii) Software development kit:  This project will introduce both the application programming interfaces as well as the isolation mechanisms to allow third parties, whether other vendors or data center operators, to introduce new network functionality based on the Stateless platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves addressing complexities in fluid management, one of the most important issues in critical care. Suboptimal fluid management results in many complications such as pulmonary edema. Studies show that fluid overload is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies also show that restrictive fluid resuscitation protocols result in a reduction of mechanical ventilation days and hospital length of stay. The clinical literature provides ample evidence of optimized fluid therapy benefits for different patient populations including those with sepsis and post-operative patients. However, implementation of fluid therapy is highly subjective. Specifically, the most critical unanswered questions involve the timing and the volume of fluid infusions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a system which uses continuous measurements from a standard intensive care unit hemodynamic monitoring device to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid and vasoactive drug management. In the proposed Phase II work, we will further develop the clinical decision support system developed in Phase I. This includes further development of the underlying technology and also performing preliminary clinical studies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable mobile robots to coexist harmoniously with people in their homes and offices. The market for consumer and office robots is projected to grow 17% annually, seven times faster than the market for manufacturing robots, reaching $1.5B by 2019. An important step toward market growth is creating autonomous robots that are unobtrusive, intelligent, and highly agile. Accomplishing this requires robots to be small enough to stay out of the way and fast enough to elegantly avoid humans and environmental obstacles. Inappropriate noise levels and safety concerns make it unlikely that airborne vehicles will be prevalent in indoor environments, whereas wheeled mobile robots can achieve near-silent operation. Tiny, fast robots are unobtrusive enough to use as a low-cost surveillance tool in home or office security, and portable enough for covertly investigating hostile situations. People with severe disabilities could travel vicariously by combining a virtual reality headset with a telepresence robot.
    Fast maneuvering robots could be used as a compelling educational or entertainment platform for kids and adults.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will integrate the Phase I feasibility work on multi-surface aggressive maneuvering for small robots into a consumer-affordable hardware platform suitable for commercialization. In addition to developing a miniaturized robotic platform, this project will also address challenges outside the scope of Phase I related to home-scale autonomous navigation to locations of interest, which can be fixed (such as a room) or dynamic (such as the location of a pet). Such challenges
    include multi-room mapping, planning, path execution, and high-speed obstacle avoidance. This project will also develop fail-safe reactive techniques for navigation in situations where a model of the environment is either incorrect or altogether unavailable. Four key Phase II objectives will address these challenges: 1) multi-room surface-aware maneuvering with vision-based localization, 2) efficient maneuvering in the presence of obstacles and clutter, 3) map initialization for monitoring places of interest, and 4) development of the final hardware platform.

    This SBIR Phase I project will produce an innovative reading application and administrative portal to support science learning. Although the science textbook is a central curricular resource, this resource is often inaccessible and difficult to read. Science textbooks are syntactically (grammatically) and semantically (word meaning) complex. Specifically, elementary and secondary science texts are often written 3 to 5 years beyond what is developmentally appropriate. Because of these complexities, science textbooks often overwhelm students' working memory, preventing them from constructing accurate mental representations of the target concepts. Thus, this project will develop and test a multiplatform, personalizable e-reader with embedded reading and language support. The intellectual merit of the effort resides in its ability to improve science comprehension through personalized and adaptive content. This project will produce content and assessments targeting the Next Generation Science Standards associated with Earth and Space Science. The customizable features will make fundamental science knowledge more accessible and interesting to students -- and thus the Public. Given these benefits, it has strong potential to support future generations of STEM professionals and a more scientifically literate citizenry.


    This project will produce a multiplatform reading application to support science learning. The key innovation will be to make science content adaptable and adjustable for learners. This Phase II project has five technical goals: (a) develop and test the e-reader to work via tablet and mobile web; (b) develop and test enhanced reading features; (c) develop and test administrative and payment portals; (d) develop and curate NGSS-aligned content and assessments; (e) conduct user testing with students and teachers. During Phase II, the project team will address some technological challenges in bringing this innovation to market. The key features of the interactive reading application create a potential for unnecessary memory load. This technological challenge will be overcome by architecting the program to be highly preprocessed and modular. A second challenge is providing secure access to multi-tiered users. This technical challenge will be overcome by architecting the program to allow for secure, multiple group membership, ensuring data visibility and security. A diverse SquidBooks team, with expertise in business, software design and engineering, educational research and measurement, science education, writing, and science will achieve these goals of this Phase II project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in helping batteries exceed the quality, performance, and safety demands of mass-market electric vehicles, renewable energy generation, and next-generation consumer electronic devices. The need for high-performance batteries is accelerating, and as batteries grow in energy density, size, and production volumes, so will the issues that persist with quality. Unless these issues are addressed, they will continue to have major implications for the performance, safety, and adoption of these important technologies. The challenge is that outside of R&D labs, the industry relies on essentially the same basic data as when batteries were first invented: voltage, current, and temperature. As a result, at commercial scales, only a small percentage of batteries are inspected in a meaningful way, with methods that only provide indirect information about physical condition. This Phase 2 project is focused on developing a new platform for production-level battery inspection that directly probes the physical condition of batteries with a high testing throughput. This could lead to better decisions in manufacturing environments and could decrease system costs, increase capacity and operational lifetime, and accelerate the scale-up of promising new materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for a physical mode of inspection in battery production environments that is capable of screening every cell with high fidelity. Currently, inspection in production-level environments are limited to electrical measurements and X-rays. Electrical methods provide only indirect and cell-averaged information about physical condition, and X-rays are not practically able to detect the distribution of electrolyte within batteries nor the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (both of which strongly affect long-term reliability, performance, and safety of batteries). This Phase 2 project aims to develop a platform that utilizes sound-based methods to inspect batteries in production-environments. This will involve developing a scaled, automated hardware system as well as software and computational methods for processing and analyzing the acoustic signals. The Phase 2 project will also include various testing and validation efforts to assess the ability of acoustic analysis to both directly determine the performance quality and reliability of cells beyond beginning of life capacity and resistance, as well as to improve the performance of strings of cells and modules.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is provided by a novel data processing architecture, utilizing high-parallel in-memory computing for certain recurring and data intensive functions. Traditional computer architecture funnels all data through the central processing unit (CPU). Multiple CPU cores and very high clock frequencies are used to address the issue of ever increasing demands on data processing capability. However, the transportation capacity of data between memory and CPU cores has become a limiting factor creating a 'memory bottleneck'. This limitation is most noticeable in the recent and rapid development of artificial intelligence applications which deploy so called neuromorphic computing techniques, which in turn require a very high parallelism in computation and proportional demands on memory bandwidth. This project performs key repetitive operations within the memory itself, leveraging the inherent parallelism of the memory architecture, thereby avoiding a large percentage of the data transport otherwise required. The resulting elimination of the memory bottleneck provides a path forward for high complexity neuromorphic computing applications such as autonomous navigation used for self-driving cars. Reduced demands on data transport and CPU also significantly reduce power consumption, enabling a wide variety of mobile artificial intelligence applications.

    The proposed project investigates the system level integration challenges of a memory-centric neuromorphic computing approach, and aims to demonstrate a seamless integration with existing software platforms currently using traditional neuromorphic computing processors. It is important for a novel hardware platform to be compatible with existing software in order to lower barriers to market entry. This Phase II project also develops the actual semiconductor product which has been investigated in Phase I as a feasibility demonstrator. The Phase II product is based on a non-volatile high density memory architecture, and as such is expected to provide the full capability in terms of both power and operations per second. Once the hardware is available in the second half of the project, these key parameters will be thoroughly characterized and benchmarked against the current state of the art technology. A projection will be made outlining the future scaling potential using ultra high density volatile and non-volatile memory geared towards high complexity neuromorphic computing beyond what is currently possible using existing approaches.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop a novel low-cost molecular filter for use in harsh environments. This is accomplished using commodity silica gel, commonly found as a desiccant in food packing, whose pores can be made to be only a few molecules wide. Accurate tuning of the size and shape of the silica gel pores enables certain molecules to pass through while others are blocked from passing. One promising application for these molecular filters is their use in grid-scale energy storage. Flow batteries could store city-sized quantities of renewable energy. However, they require the use of expensive molecular filters that are not easily replaced due to the harsh battery environments. The low-cost filters developed during this SBIR Phase II project have the potential to reduce the cost of flow batteries by as much as 15%, making them less expensive than grid-scale lithium ion batteries. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid. Low cost molecular filter also has commercial upside with the potential to capture a significant fraction of the $2.7 billion-dollar market. Because of this, this project could generate nearly 15 jobs and $39 million dollars in tax revenue over the next 5 years.


    This SBIR Phase II Project is developing a molecularly selective sol-gel ceramic membrane that does not require calcination or high polymer loading but also does not fracture during compression in stack applications (e.g., fuel cells and flow batteries). This is accomplished by decoupling the selective region from the region of the membrane being compressed by the stack. These membranes will be utilized to improve the performance and reduce the costs of all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB). VRFB membranes require selective transport of hydronium ions but not vanadium ions. Size and charge exclusion membranes must therefore have tight control over the pore size, shape and network structure to selectively transport ions. Towards this end, sol-gel processing and surface charge modification will be utilized to maximize proton conductivity and limit vanadium ion permeability. Optimized membrane formulations must also have excellent chemical and mechanical stability; showing no degradation after hundreds of VRFB cycles. Finally, membranes must be scaled from lab size (50 cm2) to commercial size (> 500cm2) while maintaining performance uniformity. The low-cost membranes developed during this SBIR Phase I project have the potential to reduce the cost of VRFBs by as much as 15%. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid.

    This SBIR Phase II project will expand on Phase I R&D work to build, test, and optimize a web-based software system for the classroom setting to complement the digital library app for home use developed in Phase I. This cost-effective system will further promote adult-mediated dialogic reading routines with children 0-7 years in age. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been shown to foster virtually all school and reading-readiness indicators - from cognitive and social-emotional development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. The new system also introduces foundational science knowledge and habits, such as the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The ever-widening education attainment and opportunity gaps between rich and poor result in diminished human potential and citizens unequipped for the demands of an information-based labor market. Investments in early childhood can prevent educational deficits, so a cost-effective system that coaches adults to engage children in a dialogic reading process can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps - the precursor to persistent achievement gaps - and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages they perpetuate. This project also addresses the urgent need to bolster the teaching of higher-order thinking skills by early education teachers. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and growing. Purchasers in this market are K-3 schools, preschools, Head Start, social- service agencies, and libraries, as well as individual families.


    This project will build the technical capacity to augment and measure the growth of adult-led dialogic reading with children 0-7 years in age. The systems architecture and proprietary algorithms will produce a system that increases adult capacity for dialogic questioning and exploration by using the copyrighted, text-specific guidance embedded in the library. Metrics, children's work product, and online adult-learning modules aim to incentivize and build teacher/caregiver confidence, inform school leaders, and focus them on continued application of the dialogic process to other books and subjects. Augmentations to the content management system developed in Phase I will enable the sales, distribution, management, and evaluation of all product form factors. The secure data-sharing portal and dashboard built through this project will allow institutional clients to monitor and evaluate their programs. R&D will include collection of engagement metrics, including usage data (access to which is built into the digital library) and online surveys. The core innovation to be studied is whether this product enables adults of varying educational backgrounds to practice an intellectually ambitious reading and thinking method with their children.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pilot field test controlled release polymers (CRPs) as an in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) remediation material. With a controlled time release of the oxidant payload, the CRPs technology treats contaminated water over longer periods eliminating the occurrence of contaminant rebound resulting in overall shorter cleanup time and total cost. ISCO is the fastest growing field among sub surface contaminant remediation technologies. Current commercial ISCO deployment methods utilize liquid oxidants as reagents which possess short term reactivity (days). To address contaminant rebounding, these injectable formulations require costly re-injections. This project would result in a novel product that is environmentally  benign  and  achieves sustained release  of  oxidative  agents  over extended  treatment  periods  (months  to years)  with  a  single application. CRPs are a novel technology, offering a highly tunable remediation amendment for the $1.4B Chemical Treatment Remediation Market. Ultimately, CRPs based treatments will decrease exposure to groundwater contaminants known to cause many human health disorders.

    The technical objectives in this Phase II research project will be to field test CRPs patented, controlled release polymer technology for in situ chemical oxidation of contaminated groundwater.  To support field testing, a pilot scale manufacturing process for the initial minimum viable product established in Phase I will be developed. Manufacturability will be tested in terms of product quality and stability, throughput, and cost. CRPs formulations based on multiple oxidants, will be manufactured to address a broad range of environmental contaminants including chlorinated solvents, BTEX (benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene), PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether), and petroleum hydrocarbons. CRPs will be pilot tested at two field sites with impacted soil and groundwater. The rate and duration of oxidant delivery and contaminant degradation will be measured. In particular, pilot field testing will assess the ability of CRPs to eliminate rebounding. Field data and computation modeling will be used to create a remediation design tool to prescribe future CRP dosing deployment strategies. Collectively, this Phase II program will result in a clear understanding of in-field performance of the CRPs technology to guide future full scale deployment and market uptake.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop an internet-of-things (IoT) data collection and analysis platform for collaborative STEM and big data research and education, that enables collaborative, geographically dispersed collection of data from internet enabled scientific instruments. STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) jobs are on the rise: the U.S. Department of Commerce predicts that occupations in these sectors will grow by 8.9 % from 2014 to 2024. Yet the U.S. currently faces a critical shortage of workers and students who are proficient in math and science subjects. In part, this shortage is due to a lack of interest in STEM-related fields by minorities and women. Engaging, relevant and hands on experiences are needed to encourage interest amongst these populations. This project fulfills the requests of the federal government and leading-edge STEM educators that both secondary and post-secondary institutions teach science in a way that engages students with real-world problems. The expectation is that this project will make big data accessible, while providing rewarding and appealing hands-on learning opportunities that will increase data literacy; increase scientific collaboration in education across geographic and interdisciplinary lines; and increase scientific literacy and interest across demographics, thus increasing the likelihood that students will continue to pursue scientific careers.

    The proposed technology will be the first collaborative educational IoT STEM platform to be developed, and is innovative in the field of Educational Technology, which has yet to adopt web-connected sensors that generate big data on a global scale. At present, there is no mechanism for schools to collect and share real data between classrooms and schools in an organized way. The proposed innovation allows users to communicate via a global network and is capable of being paired with an unlimited variety of scientific instruments and data sources, to support versatile, engaging, coordinated, multi-school experiments and data sharing. Data science now impacts virtually every profession in some way, and the platform will uniquely expose students to big data analytics in an engaging and relevant way. In Phase 1, feasibility of approach was firmly established. Phase II objectives will be to expand the educational platform developed in Phase I to optimize national/global impact and support applicability to big data research as well as a range of sensors. Goals include to expand tools to view and analyze data, refine and expand curriculum, develop an Application Programming Interface and create software tools to manipulate and share data/curriculum. The platform's ability to promote greater learning will also be evaluated.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of high application temperature materials available for additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, provides increased design freedom and complex features such as part consolidation and conformal cooling channels. The performance and efficiency of gas turbines and other applications can be increased by combining design improvements enabled by additive manufacturing with a suitable high temperature material. Unfortunately, existing materials either do not have sufficient high temperature performance or are not compatible with high quality printing methods. This project will develop new nickel superalloy composite additive manufacturing materials for use with high temperature gas turbine components. Successful completion of this project will result in more efficient turbines to reduce energy costs, transportation costs, and carbon emissions. The manufacturing, power generation, and aerospace industries are expected to be impacted from this project. In addition, history has demonstrated that new materials and manufacturing technologies often lead to additional unexpected innovations. This project will help the country lead in the innovation of high performance materials technology to address the needs of the $86 billion gas turbine market and to grow advanced manufacturing jobs in the US.



    This project will utilize innovative reactive additive manufacturing materials technology to develop 3D printable advanced high temperature superalloys. During additive fabrication, high melting temperature product phases will be synthesized in-situ within a superalloy matrix to significantly improve high temperature performance and improve printability. This innovative reactive additive manufacturing technology has been shown to be applicable to a wide range of materials systems including nickel superalloys in an NSF Phase I project. Metal matrix composites produced using this technology have demonstrated greatly increased strength, wear resistance, and high temperature performance relative to comparable traditional alloys. In addition, this technology has demonstrated the ability to eliminate micro and macro cracking problems with alloys that had previously been considered unprintable. This project aims to further develop one or more high temperature superalloys compatible with laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing for use in the hot sections of gas turbines. The scope of the project includes theoretical and experimental development and evaluation of novel material feedstocks, additive manufacturing processing conditions, and heat treatments. Evaluation of printed components will include measurement of density, hardness, standard and high temperature tensile properties, creep, and microstructure and phase analysis. Turbine components will be additively fabricated for pilot studies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to provide an affordable sealant for sealing joints and cracks in cement concrete pavement, asphalt concrete pavement, bridge deck, etc. In transportation infrastructure, joints are intentionally constructed in order to allow movement of the structural elements due to linear thermal expansion/contraction when temperature rises/drops. Cracks are a common failure mode in pavement, and if not properly sealed, can cause water damage and rupture of the concrete. Sealing cracks and joints is a common practice to maintain or extend the service life of structural elements. Various types of sealants are currently used with an annual market value of about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many of these sealants fail to work properly and are ineffective in extending service life. In this project, a smart sealant will be developed that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, a thermal characteristic opposite to that of concrete. The product will address a significant problem in the industry arising from thermal movement of joined/cracked structural elements. It is expected that the product will have about 0.8% market share in 5 years helping with the need for longer lasting and more reliable infrastructure.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and validation of a smart sealant technology. The root cause for joint failure is that the thermal expansion characteristics of most sealants is similar to that of concrete, i.e., contraction upon cooling and expansion upon heating. This behavior is contrary to what is required of sealants in order to avoid thermally induced separation between the sealant and the concrete. Unfortunately, few materials can fulfill this requirement in a cost effective way while maintaining other desired physical properties (such as, deformability). This Phase II project will solve the century-long problem through the use of a two-way shape memory polymer (2W-SMP) based sealant that addresses the root cause. Building upon the feasibility study of the Phase I project, the Phase II project will focus on further improving the 2W-SMP based sealant for sealing joints or cracks in pavement, and validate the product through third-party lab-scale testing, and full-scale field-level verification in both hot and humid environment and extremely cold regions. Technical outcome will include lab-scale validation, field level performance and verification, and construction protocols for this new smart material, laying a solid foundation for adoption by home owners and transportation agencies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new carbon dioxide utilization technology for the commercialization of onsite gas production. The impediment to electrochemical carbon dioxide utilization technology has been the lack of an electrolyzer design capable of high production rates and high energy efficiency. This project will yield a novel electrolyzer component to overcome these challenges and demonstrate that cost-effective carbon dioxide utilization is possible. This component can be integrated into existing electrolyzer designs, and will enable such hardware to convert carbon dioxide into specialty gases. The resulting solution will have higher safety and lower cost than conventional packaged gas. Long term, this technology could be scaled up to higher volume applications, and used as a means of converting industrial carbon dioxide emissions into useful chemicals and fuels, thereby transforming a waste product into a new revenue stream. This scalable technology could therefore be the basis for the creation of new economic value and advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States, while providing a profitable way for existing U.S. industries to reduce their emissions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build upon the promising feasibility results achieved in Phase I to increase the performance of a novel carbon dioxide electrochemical cell along key performance dimensions, in order to deliver a commercially-relevant, cost-competitive solution. A viable solution to derive specialty gases from a low-cost feedstock like carbon dioxide will need to have high performance on several dimensions: energy efficiency, high reaction rates, long lifetime, and low capital cost. It will also need to operate at a scale that is industrially relevant. In Phase II, the novel electrochemical component will be scaled up to commercial dimensions, and the performance of the component will be optimized to meet the performance requirements identified during customer interviews. The final component will form the basis for a commercial unit, capable of producing specialty gases from carbon dioxide at cost-competitive rates. It will lay the foundation for future scale-up to even larger membrane areas, which will enable industrial-scale applications of this carbon dioxide conversion technology. Carbon dioxide emissions could be converted into valuable products using this technology.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project enables
    the development of the next generation of contact lenses for vision correction
    based on a novel photomodification technique called \"LIRIC (Laser Induced Refractive
    Index Change).\" More than 2.3 billion people world-wide suffer from refractive
    error in their visual system, while over 500 million have inadequate access to
    refractive correction. Glasses are an option for refractive correction, however
    there can be practical limitations and even social stigma associated with wearing
    glasses, particularly among adolescents. Meanwhile vision correction with contact
    lenses is limited to lenses whose optical prescription is determined by their
    thickness profile. This has negative consequences for visual quality, on-eye stability
    and corneal health. The research represents a fundamental shift in how vision
    correction is applied because it alters the refractive index of an optical material,
    enabling previously unavailable visual correctors in thin, stable contact lenses.
    LIRIC uses a high repetition rate, femtosecond laser to micro-modify the local
    medium to produce custom refractive corrections in hydrogels, and in living cornea.
    LIRIC works by accumulating localized refractive index (RI) changes in an ocular
    material to create a refractive lateral gradient index lens. \n\nChanging the
    refractive index using LIRIC instead of the surface shape can lead to several
    fundamental advances for vision correction, with profound implications for vision
    care: 1) contact lenses can be manufactured specifically for patient fit and stability
    with the refractive correction decoupled from the lens shape; 2) difficult and
    irregular refractive corrections (i.e. for irregular astigmatism, presbyopia,
    and higher order aberrations) could be written more easily and with better spatial
    resolution than with existing methods; 3) multifocal and diffractive optical designs
    can be utilized for presbyopic and macular degenerative corrections. Patients
    viewing through LIRIC lenses, created in Phase I, had visual performance (visual
    acuity and contrast sensitivity) on par with a control lens. The objective of
    the Phase II work is to demonstrate that LIRIC works in contact lenses at process
    speeds necessary for commercial manufacturing. The goal of this work is to demonstrate
    that a 6.5 mm optical zone can be successfully processed in <15 seconds. To effectively
    do so, the LIRIC process has to achieve more than 1 wave of phase change (at 555
    nm wavelength) at laser scanning velocities in excess of 10 meter/second."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop novel algorithms for electrodynamic simulations in commercial clouds. Electrodynamic simulation is essential for computational prototyping in optical and radio-frequency devices. Current commercial solutions require significant upfront investment of both software and hardware. They also suffer from low productivity due to limited in-house computing resources. This project will develop a cloud-based simulation service which will provide on-demand, pay-per-use, virtually unlimited simulation capability without requiring users to purchase any hardware or software. This simulation technology will greatly improve productivity, reduce the barrier to entry, and minimize cost in the design of optical and radio-frequency applications. Moreover, it will serve multiple scientific and engineering disciplines and will facilitate the use of high-performance simulation in all phases of scientific discovery and engineering design. It will revolutionize large-scale scientific simulation and allow anyone with internet access to gain unprecedented simulation power. Ultimately, this technology will help accelerate research and development in the health, energy, and defense industries by offering intuitive, on-demand, and practically infinitely scalable scientific software to engineers and scientists at a price-point significantly lower than any other cloud computing service.

    There is currently no electromagnetic simulation software which performs efficiently in commercial clouds, because they were written under the assumption that the underlying computing platform is homogenous and has low inter-CPU communication time, i.e. low latency. Starting from the most fundamental level of space-time discretization, we will develop the first electrodynamic simulation software that is latency-tolerant and cloud-optimized. The work completed in Phase I developed several proof-of-concept cloud-based electrodynamic solvers and demonstrated that commercial cloud computing platform is a viable option for offering extremely low cost computing. The general solver to be developed in Phase II will serve a broad set of applications, and will be commercialized as the electromagnetic simulation service in the cloud, featuring a fully immersive web-based visualization interface.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be the development of a probiotic treatment that may be used to reduce or eliminates Salmonella and other infections in poultry. The recent FDA Veterinary Feed Directive will result in the use of antibiotics being phased out of livestock production. New technologies are needed to control pathogens in the absence of antibiotics. The goal of this technology is the reduction of pathogens in pre-harvest poultry, which may result in safer food and reduced foodborne illnesses.  In addition, this technology may help reduce the amount of antibiotics used in poultry production, which has been cited as a major factor in the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

    This SBIR Phase II project will result in the development of novel antimicrobial technologies using probiotics engineered to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins with remarkable bactericidal properties. During Phase I, probiotics were built successfully and tested as AMP-delivery vehicles. Probiotics are bile-resistant microorganisms that can be provided to animals safely in their food or water.  The antimicrobial probiotics will be used to test the reduction of pathogens in poultry guts. Pathogens in poultry guts are considered the major source of contamination of poultry meat during processing. The engineered probiotics will use synthetic DNA promoter regions that are designed to precisely control the delivery of AMPs at the site of infection.  The impact will be examined in field trials of probiotics with controllable AMP delivery on poultry challenged by Salmonella enteritidis and Campylobacter jejuni, two common foodborne pathogens. Antimicrobial probiotics also will be tested against Clostridia perfringens, the causal agent of poultry necrotic enteritis, an illness that causes billions of dollars in productivity losses every year in the US.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims
    to develop a MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS)-based radio transceiver providing
    a steep reduction in operating power for wireless data transmission in battery-powered
    devices. Conventional technology offerings for such radios are numerous, but with
    10's of mW of power consumption they are unable to operate for long periods on
    batteries or scavenged power. If the low power radio promised by MEMS technology
    is realized, battery life of consumer products such as wireless headphones can
    be greatly extended, and battery size reduced, saving money and increasing convenience
    to the end user. With the spread of compact wearable and consumer devices, battery
    space is becoming increasingly at a premium, strongly incentivizing lower power
    electronics. As this technology matures, the expanding interconnection of devices
    (aka, the Internet of Things) offers yet greater potential. With rapidly expanding
    market adoption of wireless connectivity for sensing, control, and data collection,
    power consumption is becoming a major limiter in device deployment. If lower power
    transceivers are available, wired devices may be replaced by wireless and battery
    replacement cycles reduced or even done away with altogether, saving time and
    money, and paving the way to true interconnection of all things. \n\nThe work
    of this Phase II SBIR project will focus on designing and verifying performance
    of the MEMS-based radios using fabrication processes suitable for mass production
    and commercial distribution. By combining MEMS technology with traditional circuit
    design, the proposed system will enable a 10x reduction in power consumption,
    low enough that these radios will allow extended operation on battery power alone.
    In the phase I project, the feasibility of the MEMS-based receiver was tested
    using resonators compatible with currently available MEMS foundry processes, and
    power consumption of the core radio-frequency transceiver components was verified
    at a low 300 mW. In phase II, these results will be expanded upon to add the additional
    transceiver components and software stack needed for a complete commercial product.
    The resultant design will be then transferred to the commercial foundry processes
    needed for mass production. The end goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete
    MEMS-based radio compatible with the widely-used Bluetooth Low-Energy protocol
    while operating on a total of only 2 mW in receive-mode."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will continue development of a non-resorbable surgical film which prevents internal tissue-attachment. The proposed device will improve post-surgical outcomes from patients who suffer from internal tissue-attachment triggered by cardiothoracic or neurological surgery. Patients who undergo surgery are at risk for developing unwanted tissue-attachment due to trauma as a result of surgical intervention. This tissue-attachment can lead to severe complications and increase the burden of post-operative care resulting additional expenditures through extended hospital stays, readmissions, and increased morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, undesirable tissue attachment can obstruct the surgical field upon re-operation when necessary. Surgical related tissue-attachment is a problem amongst many surgical procedures in a number of areas. However, cardiothoracic and neurological procedures are often more complicated than gastrointestinal or gynecologic procedures, making any complications more expensive and risky to providers, payers and patients. Additionally, re-operations in cardiac or neuro-spine cases are extremely difficult, which underscore the need for an effective solutions to prevent this malady even more urgent. A product that can effectively prevent undesirable tissue-attachment and provide the surgeon with a clear surgical field and plane of view would be highly desirable in both cardio-thoracic and neurological surgery.

    The proposed project will conduct additional pre-clinical work leading to a regulatory submission for a cardio-thoracic indication and additional validation within the neurological field. Positive animal studies completed during Phase I & IB efforts revealed the capacity of the Sintact Film? to reduce tissue attachment and provide for a clear field of view upon re-entry or re-operation. Initial Phase II work will examine the feasibility of scaling-up certain manufacturing and production processes resulting in a clinical grade product which will undergo sterility, safety, animal, biocompatibility, and mechanical testing. This testing will be compared directly to a predicate or equivalent approved medical device. Results will need to show equivalency of the Sintact Film? to the predicate device across all testing metrics. Additional Phase II work will enable further validation of the Sintact Film? for neurological indications. A larger definitive neurological study will be completed to address the capability of the Sintact Film? to be deployed effectively in a neurological setting. Positive results from this study will provide a basis for pursuing expanded indications and additional market opportunities. If successful the implications that a non-resorbable product can be an effective countermeasure in these areas would alter the current methodology in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project is to produce economically the next generation of sustainable, renewable, clean burning, high energy density, transportation biofuels. The proposed technology once successfully developed will enable existing biofuel producers to reduce their costs while increasing the value and diversity of their byproducts. It will convert their industrial waste products into tailored fatty acids suitable for biodiesel. The technology will be compatible with and complementary to cellulosic ethanol producers, and it could potentially double the amount of biodiesel produced in the U.S. today. The 227 domestic ethanol plants range in size from less than 50 to more than 150 million gallons, and they have a total annual capacity of 15 billion gallons. Every gallon of ethanol also yields 1.9 pounds of soluble organics that must be evaporated or disposed. Xylome?s technology has the potential to convert half of this stream into biodiesel and to expand biodiesel production further with cellulosic feedstocks. By converting a larger fraction of the soluble cellulosic and hemicellulosic sugars along with fermentation byproducts, Xylome will increase the efficiency of existing ethanol plants and increase biofuel production.

    The objectives of this Phase II research are to increase the rates of production, modification and release of fatty acids from non-conventional lipogenic yeast.  Fatty acids have much higher energy density than ethanol, but similar specific energy yields. Fermentation of organics to lipids can potentially occur with efficiencies equivalent to ethanol production. Lipids normally accumulate under nitrogen limiting conditions after replication has stopped. They are not excreted from the cells so recovery does not require distillation. In Phase I, Xylome scientists identified and over expressed genes that increase lipid accumulation by 1.2- to 2-fold under high nitrogen conditions. In Phase II, they will use mating, selection, screening and evolutionary adaptation to combine the best of these modifications. Xylome scientists have also targeted additional genes to modify and release fatty acids from the cell. Xylome plans to optimize lipid production both from a cellular level with metabolic engineering and from an engineering perspective through bioprocess design and cultivation conditions. Xylome will also engineer cells to use rapidly the complex mixture of soluble oligosaccharides, hemicellulosic sugars and fermentation byproducts. By applying advanced molecular techniques and synthetic biology, Xylome will open up new opportunities for sustainable biofuel production.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is in support of Branch Technology's novel Additive Manufacturing (AM) process that combines 3D printing technology and conventional construction materials to enable a new way to create buildings. The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP.  Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy.  To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world.  In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form.  Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production.  The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant.

    The technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation.  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project, in which a non-invasive respiratory muscle stimulation
    device and approach to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation will be developed,
    is a reduction in public health care expenditure and a reduction in morbidity
    for the half a million patients who have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation
    each year in the US. These patients suffer from an array of clinical complications
    (for example, pneumonia) and cost the US health care system $16 billion annually,
    a great deal of which is borne by Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the current
    reimbursement landscape economically incentivizes hospitals to wean patients at
    the earliest possible time. The proposed innovation has the potential to positively
    benefit society by providing a solution to this serious healthcare problem. In
    addition, it promises to improve our scientific understanding of respiratory muscle
    physiology and mechanics in difficult to wean patients. It will also improve our
    technical understanding of non-invasive respiratory sensors and biofeedback algorithms
    for the purposes of electrical muscle stimulation. Finally, as demonstrated by
    the number and cost of difficult to wean patients, as well as current healthcare
    reimbursement policies, the proposed innovation has potential to results in a
    considerable commercial impact.  \n \nThe proposed project will develop a non-invasive
    electrical stimulator that automatically applies stimulation to the respiratory
    muscles in synchrony with a patient?s voluntary breathing pattern. This approach
    is expected to address the imbalance between respiratory muscle strength and respiratory
    muscle load - a major factor responsible for weaning difficulty - by assisting
    ventilation during weaning sessions and strengthening the breathing muscles that
    have become weakened as a result of mechanical ventilation. In Phase 1 a functional
    prototype was developed; clinical feasibility of the approach was also demonstrated.
    \ The Phase II proposal focuses on refining the stimulation algorithm to maximize
    its clinical effectiveness and on developing a novel stimulation electrode system
    so that the device can be quickly applied to patients. In addition, methods will
    be developed to interface the technology with a mechanical ventilator to expand
    its clinical application. Finally, a complete works-like, looks-like prototype
    will be developed that is designed to international standards and is safe for
    clinical testing. The work completed in this Phase of the project will enable
    a controlled clinical trial of the proposed approach and ultimately allow the
    device to gain FDA regulatory clearance."

    deliver a cost-effective automated quality control (QC) system for manufacturing
    of radioactive drugs used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This system will
    replace current QC procedures, which involve 18 manual operations, 8 visual assessments,
    6 devices, and 8 samples of radioactive drugs. The industry's current reliance
    on manual operation, subjectivity and untraceable records impedes progress in
    radioactive drug manufacturing and presents compliance risks. Therefore, introduction
    of an automated system combining all these tests on a single platform will facilitate
    adoption of PET imaging technology beyond top tier medical centers. By addressing
    a critical current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliance need in radio-pharmaceutical
    production, which cannot be addressed with any other solutions available today,
    this solution is positioned for rapid adoption.  After adopting this system, it
    is expected that manufacturing facilities will realize 20% operating cost reduction
    and 50% reduction in time spent on QC-related activities. A reduced cost of compliance
    associated with introduction of automated QC will further contribute to the adoption
    rate.  This project will open the door to new applications of plate reader technology,
    an approach which has been traditionally confined to the fields of biochemistry
    and diagnostics.  \n\nThis Phase II effort includes four technical objectives.
    \ Firstly, the approach will be adapted to minimize the required sample volume.
    \ Methods developed in Phase I of the project required 0.5 ml of sample, a value
    which is not optimal for small manufacturers. To bring this value down to 0.2
    ml, test sensitivity will be adjusted, keeping in mind the potential dynamic range
    trade-offs.  Secondly, we will design a plastic consumable that supports adoption
    by a commercial manufacturer.  Current plastic prototype components are only suitable
    for academic sites with highly-skilled personnel.  To reduce the amount of training
    required, and to expand the applicability of this method, a new plastic component
    will be designed in order to further automate sample loading.  Third, we will
    optimize the formulation of the reagents to achieve a one-year shelf life for
    the consumable kit.  The shelf life of the reagents developed in Phase I remains
    unknown.  Therefore, accelerated stability studies will be performed to estimate
    the rates of decomposition processes, and appropriate changes will be made to
    enhance shelf life. Finally, we will develop a pilot production process for the
    newly-designed kit, in order to support early installations."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and produce a robust, hand-held, video-rate three-dimensional surface metrology system with vertical and lateral resolution of several micrometers, in order to bridge a critical existing metrology gap for precision-machined surfaces.  Many modern manufactured parts, such as turbine blades, drive shafts, orthopedics, and various additive manufactured components require in-situ metrology with high resolution for accurate characterization during manufacturing and/or maintenance operations.  Current high-resolution surface measurement systems are slow, vibration-sensitive and laboratory-based and thus are impractical for everyday use by manufacturing technicians.  Meanwhile, shop-floor inspection is often only visual, and thus qualitative rather than quantitative, leading both to rejections of acceptable components as well as potential acceptance of failing ones.  The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has hindered manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs.  This research program will yield a hand-held, easy-to-use, robust, and quantitative shop-floor measurement system, allowing manufacturers to improve lifetimes, performance, and yield as they rapidly assess the features under test and feed the results back to improve process control.

    During Phase I, a breadboard system was designed and implemented using a polarization-based fringe projection method and micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement in a compact package.  This Phase II program leverages that research to design a video-rate, compact, robust and portable system for handheld surface measurements in shop-floor environments. This will first involve improvements to measurement resolution with an improved optical design and new self-calibrating measurement modes; new optical elements will lower noise artifacts caused by imperfections in the earlier design and to reduce system size.  Once performance of the new design is verified, an ergonomic, compact, robust, wireless housing for the instrument must be created to enable shop-floor use; the system must handle drops of over one meter onto concrete, have useful battery life for extended field operations, be light enough to not fatigue users and have intuitive controls and feedback.  A final, critically important development effort will create automated software routines for measurement, analysis, and system diagnostics to enable adoption by unskilled personnel in manufacturing environments.  Lastly, extensive applications testing in the field will allow optimization of the system to handle a wide range of potential use cases and environments.

    developed in the Phase I effort, improvements will be made to scale up manufacturing
    and reduce cost in the manufacturing process. The commercial potential of this
    technology is critically dependent on achieving cost and performance parity, if
    not superiority, with traditional materials.  Each year, 1.23 trillion fired bricks
    are produced globally for use in construction, resulting in over 800 million tons
    of carbon emissions.  The societal impacts of this research would include a dramatic
    reduction in these emissions, as well as a corresponding reduction in industrial
    by-product waste. This project will enhance the technological understanding for
    commercial viability and test data including durability and physical performance.\n
    \nTechnical objectives for this effort include evaluation of the resulting biocement
    masonry products through rigorous American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM)
    testing methods, reduction of raw material costs through continued optimization,
    creation of in-house production capability for the requisite biologic product,
    and the creation and testing of a manufacturing process suitable for transition
    to licensees. Main focus areas of the Phase II project include rigorous material
    testing for physical performance, weathering and durability, in-house production
    of robust raw material constituents, and commercial testing coupled with pilot
    manufacturing. Rigorous ASTM testing methods will be done at two accredited labs,
    and labor requirements will be reduced via the adoption of lean automation in
    the production process. Additionally, the utilization of existing material handing
    manufacturing equipment at licensee facilities, where possible, will be evaluated.
    Expected project results will include a comprehensive statistical analysis of
    multiple physical samples, as well as a corresponding failure analysis. Additional
    expected deliverables include the successful commission of in-house pilot scale
    manufacturing for biocement constituents as a simplified additive to be used by
    commercial partners and licensees."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports development of a nanoparticle characterization instrument that will fill the critical unmet need to rapidly and accurately measure the size and distribution of nanoparticles from 30 nanometers to 1 micron. Initially the technology will target two applications: protein aggregation in biopharmaceuticals, and nanoparticles in medicine (e.g., tumor-targeted drug delivery). The importance of nanoparticle analysis, however, goes well beyond therapeutics. Currently the market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation across the life sciences is $5.6 billion, and there are increasing concerns about nanoparticles in consumer products such as food and cosmetics, as well as in drinking water, effluents, and the environment. A major challenge in understanding the health impacts of nanoparticles is simply in accurately and easily detecting their presence and size distribution. Additionally, improved nanoparticle instrumentation will enable new discoveries in biotechnology and environmental and health sciences.

    This challenge can be met by developing a practical method for counting and sizing submicron particles in polydisperse mixtures. NSF Phase I/IB funds supported development of a prototype instrument that detects individual nanoparticles and accurately measures their size, at very high count rates. This instrument has successfully demonstrated robust detection of individual particles as small as 60 nm in diameter at rates approaching 10,000 particles per second, and has already begun to deliver useful information to particle manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry, with on-going measurements of actual customer samples. The Phase II support will considerably enhance the utility of this instrument by addressing several outstanding technical challenges; most significantly, by extending the range of detectable particles to span the full range from 30 nm to 1000 nm, and by further maximizing the range of measurable particle concentrations.  In addition, the Phase II work will drive significant improvements in functionality and ease of use, driven by innovations in its control software. Finally, the instrument will be further validated using a wide variety of particle types relevant beyond the pharmaceutical space.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is development of a microbial technology for the conversion of low-value sugars into high-value chemicals. Most industrial chemicals produced today are derived from petroleum and other nonrenewable raw materials. The long-term growth and sustainability of the chemical industry benefits from development of new routes to existing chemicals using renewable raw materials. Furthermore, due to higher infrastructure costs and stricter environmental requirements, many chemicals that were once produced in the United States are now produced abroad. This contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. This Phase II proposal aims to develop a fermentation technology where domestically grown agricultural materials (for example, corn and waste agricultural residues) are converted into high-value chemicals. The optimized fermentation process is estimated to be cost-competitive with the incumbent petrochemical route when scaled. If successful, this proposal will facilitate growth of a domestic bio-chemical manufacturing industry, targeting the $30 billion organic acids market.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop large-scale, high-throughput techniques to optimize gene expression in industrial yeast. A significant problem within the field of industrial biotechnology is the ability to engineer and optimize the fermentation performance of non-academic or model microbes. Most molecular metabolic engineering tools are developed for use in two model prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, E. coli and S. cerevisiae, and are not suitable for use with industrially relevant microbes. Without these tools it is costly and slow to commercialize new fermentation technologies. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop and implement a set of molecular biology tools designed for acid-tolerant yeast, and working to apply them toward improving small molecule production. Specifically, the molecular biology tools are useful for tuning (up- or down-regulation) user-defined gene transcription and translation. Engineered microbes harboring the desired genetic modification(s) are assayed for improved small molecule production from sugar in small scale fermentations. Successful genetic modifications are those that result in more efficient small molecule product formation from sugar, and ideally decreased biomass formation from sugar, providing a lower production cost in a scaled, commercial process.

    Research Phase II project is the sustainable production of high-value lipids (oils,
    waxes and fatty acids) from abundant and inexpensive feedstocks. The process is
    based on a unique lipid- accumulating microorganism found in Yellowstone National
    Park that is capable of directly converting a wide range of feedstocks such as
    wheat straw, corn stover, and industrial by-products (e.g. molasses, glycerol)
    to valuable lipid products such as Omega-7 fatty acids and high-melting temperature
    waxes. Renewable oils, waxes and fatty acids have significant demand in a wide
    range of industries (e.g. neutraceuticals, biolubricants, cosmetics, candles and
    soaps). Consumers will clearly benefit from this technology through the reduction
    of our dependence on petroleum-based products while generating a market for agricultural
    wastes and by-products. Since few companies and research groups are investigating
    fungal lipid production directly from lignocellulosic biomass for higher- value
    products, both industry and the scientific community will benefit from the knowledge
    gained by this research. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
    project describes a simple, novel and cost-effective process for converting lignocellulosic
    and other waste feedstocks to high- value lipids using a microorganism isolated
    from Yellowstone National Park, which is capable of withstanding extreme acidic
    conditions and producing powerful enzymes for degrading cellulose, lignin and
    hemicellulose. The organism accumulates high concentrations of valuable lipids
    in a cost-effective ?one-step? process. The produced lipids based on renewable
    resources creates a market for waste agricultural materials. The primary objective
    of this SBIR project is to further develop the process for commercial production
    of lipid products from waste organic feedstocks. Phase II efforts will focus on
    optimizing the process with a bench pilot-scale system, performing process flow
    design and techno-economic analysis of commercial production systems, analyzing
    lipid products in detail, and targeting appropriate markets/customers for the
    produced lipid products. Coming out of the Phase II program, the goal is to have
    a pilot- level demonstration system designed to produce economically viable yields
    of high-value lipids from a variety of substrates for defined target markets and
    customers."

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a novel engineered microbiome as a potential therapeutic for a rare skin disease called Netherton syndrome. Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare, severe skin disease with high mortality and few treatment options. This proposal aims to develop a new therapeutic for this disease, a microbe-based protein delivery system of LEKTI, the missing protein responsible for NS symptoms. At the end of this project, a candidate live biotherapeutic product candidate (LETKI-secreting strain of S. epidermidis) will be nominated and the Company will have sufficient data with which to proceed into formal preclinical studies and subsequent human testing. This proposed product will have the potential to address thousands of patients in the U.S., and the broader proof-of-principle of this microbe-based technology offers significant potential to treat millions of patients living with skin conditions. This offers significant advances in innovation in addition to broad commercial potential.

    This project aims to develop a novel therapeutic candidate composed of an engineered strain of S. epidermidis that secretes LEKTI protein to the skin for the treatment of Netherton syndrome (NS). NS is a rare but severe autosomal recessive disease that affects the skin, hair, and immune system. NS is caused by mutations in in the SPINK5 gene encoding the serine protease inhibitor lymphoepithelial Kazal-type related inhibitor (LEKTI), which contains 15 serine protease inhibitory domains. The goal of this Phase II project is to demonstrate a proof-of-concept therapeutic for NS: an engineered commensal microbe that delivers discrete domains of LETKI to the skin. The proposed Phase II research plan will establish critical criteria for nominating a potential live biotherapeutic product (LBP) candidate composed LEKTI-secreting S. epidermidis. This research will perform key activities in preclinical development of an LBP: identify an optimal sequence of LEKTI; develop analytical methods for detecting LEKTI secreted from an engineered strain of S. epidermidis; and develop analytical methods for measuring biodistribution and adsorption of LEKTI secreted by S. epidermidis in a human in vitro model.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project touches upon everything from shower doors to
    consumer electronics to window glass. Deposition of high-quality thin films on
    a large scale with precise energy control can allow, for one example, diamond-like
    carbon (DLC) on glass.  DLC coatings on glass can prevent soapy film build-up
    on shower doors, can improve the scratch resistance of mobile phone displays,
    and can reduce the cost of energy-conserving windows. The control of energy during
    fabrication processes won't just broaden what films can be made; it will allow
    the use of a greater variety of substrates. In recent years, a number of applications
    have utilized traditional inorganic coatings like silicon oxide on top of new
    materials like organic solar cells and organic LEDs. These organic materials show
    greater sensitivity to degradation during the coating processes. This ion beam
    source can give industry, as it begins to bring these innovations to market, a
    tool with the level of energy control that will allow lab results to translate
    to high yield, low cost manufacturing. \n\nThe proposed project addresses the
    challenge of depositing advanced thin films on insulating and/or delicate substrates.
    Control of the deposition's energy flux has been shown in laboratory demonstrations
    to be required for many thin films including diamond-like carbon, transparent
    conductive oxides on silicon and organic solar cells, and ultra-thin silver. A
    scalable linear ion beam sputter source will establish a high-volume manufacturing
    tool for thin films limited today to much smaller scale. In Phase 1, the source's
    functionality was demonstrated. Phase 2 has two major components: hardware development
    for scale and usability; process development for specific commercial applications.
    The company will deliver a fully integrated control system and a source, scaled
    by 2x and designed for manufacture. Process development will consider beam energetics
    and geometry of beam/target/substrate relative to film and substrate properties.
    For DLC, this will focus on tribological and optical properties. For silver, they
    will test for continuity of ultra-thin films. Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO)
    efforts will focus on electrical properties and substrate impacts, particularly
    carrier lifetime in silicon.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery platform that will identify novel types of antibody therapeutics.  The goal is to use antibodies to increase or decrease the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor called "G protein-coupled receptors" (GPCRs). There are more than 400 non-olfactory human GPCRs that are involved in all aspects of health and disease, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, pain, inflammation, and others. About 25% of GPCRs have been targeted by approved small molecule drugs, but efforts for the remaining have often failed because of the inability of small molecules to distinguish between similar GPCRs. Antibody drugs can overcome this hurdle because of their much higher specificity for their targets. This project will bring to commercialization the first technology that directly identifies antibodies that modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact healthcare by enabling therapies for diseases with poor or no current treatments. They also will impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The GPCR drug market is over $100B, and most antibody therapeutics have annual sales over $1B. The platform described here could enable dozens of novel GPCR antibody therapeutics, creating value for patients, society, and co-development partners.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery technology for discovering antibodies that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Current methods are limited because GPCR antigens are often not properly folded, and because antibodies are selected by how tightly they bind GPCRs, rather than by the effect they exert. Those that bind typically do not have any effect at all. This project will build on the successful proof-of-concept from Phase I that demonstrated the platform's ability to identify directly functional antibody agonists for a human GPCR. The proposal addresses the four main technical requirements that pharmaceutical customers cite as important: Ability to work on many types of GPCRs, ability to isolate antibodies with varied modulating effects, use of a highly diverse, high-quality scFv library, and a workflow that can quickly isolate, optimize and characterize dozens of candidates. The goals of this project are to improve how the platform's yeasts express GPCRs and functionally couple them to different selectable readouts, construct a proprietary scFv library, and optimize the workflow by incorporating sequencing bioinformatics and antibody characterization, including flow cytometric analysis of cell-binding and functional assays on cultured mammalian cells.

    new and innovative products. It is a key to strengthening the US manufacturing
    economy. Continued growth and health of the 3D printing industry, particularly
    for manufacture of functional parts for finished goods, will depend upon an expansion

    that material library with development of printable polyurethane elastomers with
    a broad range of flexibilities. These materials will be particularly relevant
    for markets that demand personalization and customization, such as patient-specific
    medical devices, sporting goods, and footwear. Manufacturers of flexible, durable
    polyurethane goods for industrial and automotive products will also benefit from
    low cost small-scale production of parts made from materials with performance
    that match their product specifications. The printing system will enable production
    of parts with user-specified geometry and flexibility, and will also enable multi-material
    printing for novel product designs. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will produce

    liquid, reactive feeds. The research approach will include determination of the
    starting materials to control reaction rates, rheology development, and part solidification.
    Software development will incorporate printing parameters for the spectrum of
    materials that can be produced from the starting materials in order to produce
    a user interface where part flexibility is specified as a function of part geometry,
    and the printer receives commands for printing the desired object.  The material

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a user-friendly and scalable infection control surveillance software platform using advanced biotech and data analytics for monitoring hospital-acquired infection. There is a significant clinical problem in hospitals, where 1 in 25 people who check in will develop a hospital acquired infection. Currently, hospital infection control practitioners (ICPs) have few analytical tools to identify the source of these infections, which can be deadly and cost the health care industry an estimate of $45 billion year. The innovation under development harnesses advanced epidemiological approaches in an easy-to-use application that will enable ICPs to use bacterial genetics as a means to monitor infectious spread within their system so that their sources can be eliminated.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to develop an infection control surveillance software system using whole-genome sequencing of pathogens and advanced data analytics.  The innovation addresses the critical lack of accessible genetic analysis applications designed for local infection control surveillance. Hospitals are observing ever increasing rates of antibiotic resistant infections. These are expensive, endanger patients, and are becoming harder to trace as medical care becomes more complex and spread over multiple facilities. Unfortunately, ICPs have few new tools, other than best hygiene practices, to reduce their mounting infection rates. Decades of research has revealed that epidemiological surveillance using genetic analysis provides a robust level of pathogen traceability; however, this knowledge has not been transferred into hospitals where it is critically needed, due to a lack of technical infrastructure and analytical accessibility. In this Phase II project, the goal is to complete the development of a software application that will enable ICPs to easily and accurately process bacterial genetic data in their own offices and generate rich, meaningful and easy to interpret reports concerning bacterial spread in their networks. ICPs will be warned when infection sources relate to each other, suggesting that a deeper investigation is needed. The result is that infection sources, which are currently missed, will be proactively identified and targeted.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide commercial validation at scale of feedback-based control of arc behavior within the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process.  This will improve VAR performance in the production of specialty metals, resulting in improvements to ingot quality while reducing electricity consumption.  Specialty metals, such as titanium and nickel alloys, are used in critical high-performance parts in industries such as aerospace, energy, and medicine, where the failure of these parts may lead to catastrophic systems failures and potentially life-threatening situations. In a VAR furnace, extreme temperature gradients from constricted and/or diffuse arcs sustained between the melting electrode and ingot can cause non-homogeneous material and inclusion defects, resulting in up to 8% yield loss per ingot, representing $1.024 billion in losses across the domestic industry.  Improved control over the arc distributions during the melting of these metals is expected to decrease the frequency of defects in the final product and increase overall yield from the process. The proposed project is expected to reduce these loses by up to 50% through the application of active, feedback control of the arc dynamics. This type of control is expected to increase yield, decrease energy requirements, and increase safety of the manufacturing process industry-wide.

    This project will result in a system capable of detecting and manipulating the distribution of the arcs utilized during VAR processing. The Phase I effort showed that it is possible to simultaneously detect arc locations on the electrode and influence their movements, using electromagnetic coils, in real time. In Phase II, the arc measurements will be coupled through feedback to control the arc distribution in an industrial-scale research VAR, providing proof of concept at industrial scale. In so doing, the optimal electromagnetic coil geometry, hardware, and materials for driving the arc motion at scale will be identified and constructed. A series of industrial experiments are planned to validate the control system. The chemical composition of the ingots produced during controlled and uncontrolled conditions will be characterized to correlate defects with observed arc behaviors and to identify optimal control parameters.  Similarly, the measured arc distributions will be used to validate the computational solidification modeling, which will be used to identify probable defect regions. The combination of experimental data and validated simulation results will be used to inform the VAR feedback control system regarding optimal arc distribution, yielding an improved control strategy for tailoring the melt process and improving ingot quality.

    Research (SBIR) project are foundations for an emerging industry: insects in agriculture.
    \ Beta Hatch is pioneering the production of new animal feed ingredients, developing
    technology to mass produce insects, and creating STEM jobs. The proposed work
    will allow scaling insects as a sustainable protein-rich feed ingredient. With
    predictable year-round production, this will contribute to a more robust and secure
    agricultural system. The Beta Hatch insect ranch, which will be designed through
    integration of the results from this project, is an on-site solution to convert
    organic by- products into valuable feed ingredients and fertilizer. These ranches
    are being designed as conversions of underutilized spaces (warehouses and poultry
    barns), to bring jobs to rural and HUBZone areas. We work closely with farmers,
    our main customers, to establish the performance and economic value of our products.
    Insects provide nutrition and make animals healthier. Our frass (insect manure),
    is an organic fertilizer that stimulates healthy soils, and has no nitrates (no
    runoff). The proposed work will allow us to establish insects as the world?s most
    sustainable animal feed ingredient, and to disrupt the $400B animal feed market.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to cost effectively scale insect production
    for agricultural markets. Of the millions of insect species that exist, only a
    handful have been successfully reared under controlled conditions and even fewer
    have been mass produced. And yet insects have the potential to fill essential
    roles in agricultural supply chains by biodegrading wastes, removing or recycling
    toxins, and providing nutrition for animals. In order to meet the scale, quality
    and cost requirements for agricultural markets, significant R&D must solve some
    core challenges in insect mass production. We propose to integrate biological
    and engineering approaches to develop novel oviposition substrates, identify and
    mitigate causes of mortality, design automated and flexible diet handling systems,
    optimize rearing trays (the basic unit of production), and maximize yields with
    automated water and diet delivery. The proposed work will cut over 80% of our
    costs, produce several patents, and inform the design of a scalable insect ranching
    facility. As a natural part of animal diets, insects are a predictable protein-rich
    alternative feed ingredient, with year-round controlled production. In Phase 1
    of this project, we established an insect breeding program, explored novel inorganic
    diets, and identified the core production challenges for scaling insects-as-feed.
    For this NSF SBIR Phase 2 project, we develop solutions that will reduce the cost
    of production and control the cost of future facilities.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation

    the fabrication of devices capable of focusing X-rays with high energy (from 10
    keV to above 100 keV) to spot sizes as small as 7 nanometers.  This capability
    is critical for imaging, microtomography, and elemental and structural analyses
    of materials and will permit imaging in spectral ranges and at resolutions unavailable
    today. These devices will enable scientists to better image the interplay of structure
    and functionality for a wide variety of applications, including the development
    of life-saving drugs, the creation of materials for high-tech devices, and for
    a number of important basic scientific purposes. The devices? primary use will

    class of high-value consumables, addressing a global market segment worth about
    $7 million today with the potential to increase to more than $14 million in the
    near future. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is threefold. First, the
    innovative method of fabrication explores and exploits the ultimate capability
    of atomic layer deposition (ALD) for achieving nanometer-scale smoothness in very
    thick, multilayer films. Unlike related methods that rely on deposition onto wires
    and slicing, this method uses ALD to deposit sequences of low and high refractive
    index materials onto batch-fabricated cylindrical silicon precursors, with well-controlled
    layer thicknesses varying from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers. Subsequently,
    polishing the wafer will yield membranes with hundreds of high-value focusing
    devices on a single wafer, minimizing the processing costs per device. Second,
    the envisioned wafer-level processing method allows for a necessary tilt control
    of the precursors, not possible with wires, for better focusing properties. Third,
    the method is extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material
    layers, which enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index diffractive devices
    with single foci and featuring ultimate diffraction efficiency. Phase I qualified
    the individual key processes and proved their integration capability into a complete
    fabrication sequence, while Phase II will deal with the fabrication and testing
    of prototypes and preparation for production, using long runs of atomic layer
    deposition processes, as is necessary for functional devices.\n\nThis award reflects

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate an additive manufacturing process to produce 3-D woven textile products at scale. Presently, the clothing manufacturing industry still relies on manual sewing machines that were invented over one-hundred and seventy years ago. This system limits the manufacturing process and textile capability; an abundance of steps leads to waste, inefficiencies, and segmented products. Further, due to the low cost of foreign labor, the US textile industry has effectively come to a halt: 97.3 percent of all clothing sold in the United States in 2015 was imported. This project seeks to develop a novel method for manufacturing woven textile products by employing additive manufacturing methodologies to automate the production process, while simultaneously enabling complete customization and on-demand production. This technology will enable premium and competitive textile manufacturing to return from overseas, creating high value-added jobs and a designer community in the United States while also generating tax revenue. In the same way that 3-D printing technology has revolutionized the hard goods manufacturing process, this project seeks to create an entire new industry of additively manufactured textile products, enabling significant opportunities for future innovation.

    This project develops a novel technology to manufacture near-net-shape three dimensional woven textile products. To develop this technology, this project first proved feasibility through creating constituent textile panels of non-standard shapes with 3-D topography in Phase I, laying the foundation for continued development into fully three-dimensional, seamless, finished products produced in-situ through Phase II. By additively producing garments from a unique 3-D model complete customization to each individual consumer is possible on a large scale, though this has never before been accomplished. Further, through the on-demand production of clothing customized to individual consumers, the need for substantial inventory buildup is eliminated. In this way, additively manufactured textile products are both more desirable to consumers and more economical to producers. As such, the societal and environmental benefits of automated and on-demand textile manufacturing within the United States are significant, including eliminating massive amounts of waste from typical cut-and-sew manufacturing techniques, revamping a struggling American manufacturing industry, and minimizing the economical, environmental, and geopolitical implications of the United States? current dependence on a convoluted global supply chain.

    HI-Light - a photo-thermo-catalytic reactor platform technology that enables the
    conversion of CO2 and water to synthesis gas at a rate significantly greater than
    the state of the art.  The unique feature of the technology is that it uses embedded
    optical waveguides to evenly distribute light within the reactor, increasing the
    efficacy of the catalyst and ultimately the productivity of the system.  In Phase
    I a fully functional integrated prototype reactor was constructed, demonstrating
    continuous operation, and showing productivity in terms of the grams of hydrocarbon
    produced per gram of catalyst per hour more than 10x greater than the state of
    the art.  The approach solves the two major roadblocks in photo-conversion of
    CO2: (1) the semiconductor catalysts can only use photons with energies greater
    than their bandgap, which is a small fraction of those present in sunlight and
    (2) a large fraction of the catalyst material in these reactors is under-utilized
    due to sub-optimal light and reactant delivery.  Our unique reactor uses a patented,
    multi-scale approach to enhance light and reagent transport directly to the reaction
    site and makes use of traditionally unused photons to provide heat and enhance
    reaction efficiency.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the development of a lithium metal battery using a novel Liquefied Gas Electrolyte. While there is an intense global effort to advance electrolyte chemistry for next-generation lithium batteries, these efforts focus almost entirely on liquid and solid-state electrolytes. In contrast, this project aims to further develop the use of a novel class of electrolytes which use solvents that are typically gaseous at room temperature and liquefied under moderate pressures. Phase I work demonstrated world-record cycling lithium metal with an average plating/stripping coulombic efficiency of >99.5% over 400 cycles with (0.5 mA/cm2 and 0.5 mAh/cm2 each cycle) with smooth and highly dense lithium deposition as observed through cryogenic focused-ion-beam characterization. Further, a world-record low temperature electrolytic conductivity of 3 mS/cm at -80 ?C for lithium-based electrolytes was obtained, far exceeding the state-of-art. Lastly, a reversible high temperature shut-down at +40 ?C, due to a decrease in electrolyte conductivity from salt precipitation, was demonstrated. This high temperature shut-down essentially eliminates thermal runaway reaction from occurring, making for a significantly safer battery.

    Further development of these electrolytes through this NSF Phase II grant will enable further work to increase battery specific energy to 450 Wh/kg, expand operating temperatures from -60 to +60 ?C, and increased safety with no thermal runaway while maintaining power and cycle life comparable to conventional Li-ion. This will be accomplished with further development of the electrolyte chemistry to improve lithium metal coulombic efficiency to >99.8% over 1000 cycles, increase the high temperature shut-down to +60~70 ?C, increasing cathode performance to higher voltages and cycle life, and the development of a high throughput R&D line which will offer high precision addition of electrolyte components to fine tune the chemistry. Because the electrolyte chemistry may use several common materials and manufacturing methods, there should be low cost barrier to entry and it is expected there will be significant cost reduction in volume production down to the goal of $100/kWh. The developed technology will be especially well suited for low temperature applications such as high-atmosphere, defense, and aerospace which frequently endure extreme temperatures and require high specific energy. Because of the superior performance at low temperatures compared to the incumbent, South 8 Technologies will first focus on developing the technology in these areas. As the technology matures, an eventual move into grid storage and transportation markets will follow, leading to a substantial decrease in emissions and reliance on imported fuels. The underlying fundamental chemistry with these new materials is a relatively new field and may potentially lead to significant advances in next-generation energy storage devices and broader technologies, leading to new industries, job growth and beyond.

    This SBIR Phase II project, the Engineering Design Instruction Software for implementing Objectives of Next generation standards (EDISON), will combine Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) concepts together with engineering design, simulation, Augmented Reality (AR), 3-D printing, and real-world experiments. The project will create a collaborative platform for middle school engineering projects where students create, analyze, simulate, and construct designs for several types of projects like bridges, cars, circuits, simple machines, drones, and robots. This project will provide positive experiences with STEM and engineering in middle school, when many students lose interest in these economically vital fields. EDISON will foster STEM engagement and inquiry in middle school, by leveraging gaming, team collaboration, 3D printing, and augmented reality. The project will create engineering experiences that connect math and science content directly to real world applications to improve student academic performance in traditional science and math subjects. This work has the potential to promote effective integration of engineering in K-12, prepare students for future careers, expand scientific literacy, and engage diverse groups of students in STEM, supporting NSF's mission.


    This SBIR Phase II project will produce a collaborative engineering design platform for middle school, containing realistic design tools, content creation, embedded standards-based STEM assessment, and tools supporting prototyping and testing. EDISON provides end to end solutions for team-based engineering in middle schools and maintains engagement through gamification. This project will develop sophisticated tools that are lacking in existing engineering curricula, and support math and science standards alignment using model-based engineering, virtual design collaboration, and embedded tools for student evaluation. In this work the Phase I prototype will be extended by developing reusable design modules for circuit design, simple machines, aerodynamics, and programming. Testing tools using sensors and Augmented Reality will be added for real world data collection and analysis. Numerous modular standards aligned lessons and a content creation interface to facilitate EDISON?s transition to an instructional platform will be created. Finally, in collaboration with our University partner EDISON will be extensively tested and student outcomes evaluated in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade classrooms using a combination of embedded, quantitative, and qualitative methods. The goal is to better meet the STEM instructional needs of educators and students with superior capabilities, engaging experiences, and easy to use tools.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to enable organizations - whether businesses, governments, or non-profits - to make more informed, more data-driven decisions. All organizations must decide how to allocate limited resources and do so in the context of meeting a set of objectives, such as profit, social wellbeing, or health. Modeling as a process and models as artifacts of that process allow decision makers to understand data through the lens of objectives and to then make decisions; data alone, no matter how much, cannot make decisions. As more aspects of the world are instrumented and captured digitally, the breadth and quantity of data will out of necessity require larger, more complex models to be built. Organizations will need a modeling workflow and supporting tools that scale with these demands.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the challenge of many users collaboratively building and maintaining analytical models that are consistent and reproducible while allowing for divergent and convergent change. This project will address the resource management challenges identified in development and the interactivity gaps identified in user testing of the Phase I prototype. The result will be a commercial software application for building models that manages code, data, and the evolution of both over time by many users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the creation of a new tool that could prevent the loss of sensitive data stored in big data management systems due to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the proposed cybersecurity tool can allow organizations to audit their big data usage to prevent data misuse and comply with various privacy regulations. Recent attacks have shown that the leakage/stealing of stored data may result in enormous monetary loss and damage to organizational reputation, and increased identity theft risks for individuals. Furthermore, in the age of big data, protecting the security and privacy of stored data is paramount for maintaining public trust, and getting the full value from the collected data. The company's proposed tool will potentially have significant impact by addressing these important societal needs with respect to big data security and privacy. Based on customer discovery findings, this tool will also address an important customer need found in many different industries and has the potential to have significant commercial impact as more and more companies are adopting big data technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will commercialize a novel big data privacy, security and governance management tool that provides efficient data sanitization, attribute-based access control, accountability and governance policy enforcement capabilities for protecting sensitive data stored in big data management systems. In addition, the proposed product will provide novel data sensitivity aware intrusion detection capabilities. The Phase II research objectives are: 1) to develop an efficient attribute-based access control framework to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data; 2) to develop data sanitization capabilities for complying with various regulations; 3) to develop a scalable audit log capture, storage and querying framework for increasing accountability for big data usage; and 4) to develop a data sensitivity aware intrusion detection framework to quickly detect potential attacks against sensitive data. These objectives pose significant research challenges with respect to scaling to big data without impacting the existing workflow of the companies. The company proposes to address these challenges by using novel code injection techniques combined with risk aware audit log generation and data sensitivity aware machine learning based intrusion detection techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project centers on bringing enhanced independence, productivity, and quality of life for hundreds of thousands of individuals in the US who live with severe physical disability due to spinal cord injury or other debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Due to improvements in emergency medicine and increasing average age, these individuals represent a growing population that is underserved by current assistive technologies (ATs). The ATs being relied upon to carry out basic tasks are still primitive, offer limited versatility, and fail to meet end-user needs. Meanwhile, computers and internet play ever-growing roles in everyday life and are regarded as equalizers that allow individuals to have similar vocational, recreational, and educational opportunities. The Tongue Drive System (TDS) offers individuals with severe physical disabilities an intuitive and superior mechanism for accessing computer-based resources, wheelchairs, smartphones, smart homes, etc. TDS harnesses the power of the human tongue, which often retains full capability in these individuals despite losses of other functions, to drive human-computer interactions. TDS has the potential to revolutionize the current AT market in the US and around the world with an anticipated market size of $1B within its primary market segment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project aims to bring this transformative and game-changing AT to market by continuing the design, development, evaluation, and expansion of a robust, reliable, and real-time TDS ecosystem. In Phase-I, the TDS hardware was redesigned and consolidated so that all signal processing functions were self-contained into a new standalone TDS (sTDS) headset system with a dual-band wireless link that can directly interface with a target peripheral by transmitting formatted user-defined commands. In Phase-II the designs for a solid and intuitive user interface, a smartphone app, and a robust and rugged powered wheelchair interface module to effectively control key target devices will be fine-tuned in the final stages of development in preparation for launch. The sTDS hardware/software/enclosure will also be tested and ready for manufacturing and meet the FDA regulatory requirements towards submission of a 510(k) premarket notification.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable Unmanned Aerial Systems
    (UAS or drones) to safely and reliably operate from moving vehicles and moving vessels at sea.
    There is an immediate need for this capability in many industries. In commercial fishing, drones
    will replace manned aircraft for fish-finding operations, radically reducing cost and risk. In maritime
    security, drones will provide surveillance around ships, including locating a ?man-overboard? in
    time to save the person?s life. In the oil and gas industry, drones will provide rapid-response to oil
    spills by mapping the location and extent of the oil slick, limiting the environmental and economic
    damage. In hydrographic surveying, drones will identify and geo-locate navigation aids, at a
    fraction of the time and cost of current survey methods. In commercial shipping, drones will
    inspect and protect shipping vessels while they are underway. In the transport industry, drones
    will delivery packages the ?last mile? from a delivery truck to a customer?s door. In law enforcement
    and border security, drones will operate from moving patrol vehicles while officers remain safe
    and mobile in the vehicle. These applications are currently difficult or impossible, but will become
    radically safer and easier with the proposed technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will advance the current state
    of the art in UAS/drone autonomy, to enable reliable drone operations from moving vehicles and
    moving vessels at sea. Shipboard landing is extremely difficult, due to the heaving and rolling of
    the ship deck, potential high winds, and the high precision control required during landing. Current
    drone technology does not facilitate landing on moving platforms; this prevents their use in
    maritime operations, and has become the main barrier to commercialization in this sector. The
    proposed research will develop a vision-aided relative navigation system that combines precise
    air-to-ship observations with onboard sensor measurements to accurately estimate the relative
    state between the drone and the ship. These relative state estimates will be used to dynamically
    route and control the drone safely on to the ship deck. Technical feasibility of this approach has
    been demonstrated during the Phase I project, which included demonstration of the technology
    in a relevant environment. The primary goals of the Phase 2 project are to improve system
    reliability, expand the operational envelope, and productize our system. The plan to achieve these
    goals includes scientific development paired with extensive testing, validation, and demonstration.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a manufacturing platform for opioid
    medicines. Opioids enable physicians to provide compassionate care to patients
    suffering from acute or chronic disease and trauma. The need for opioid analgesics
    is even more salient for surgeons anticipating the post-operative recovery of
    their patients and planning for end-of-life care. However, opioids are highly
    addictive medicines, a property that has been exploited for commercial gain by
    certain players in the pharmaceutical industry. The impact of this project will
    be to deliver a technology that transforms the existing supply chain for opioids
    by removing the need to grow opium poppy as a drug crop. Instead of sourcing poppy
    materials from poppy-growing countries, this new technology will allow for complete
    production of opioids in a secure industrial facility located in the United States
    where federal agencies can provide oversight and regulation. Additionally, investment
    in this technology will enable the development of many more existing and experimental
    medicines derived from plants, including greatly improved opioids with improved
    efficacy and safety, and cardiovascular and chemotherapeutic therapies that will
    extend and enhance human lives.   \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will develop
    a bioprocess for opioid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). To date, the
    only commercially-competitive method for manufacturing opioids and related alkaloids
    is to extract these molecules from plants. However, Baker's yeast was recently
    engineered to biosynthesize opioids, which is a technological advance that could
    enable opioid production by fermentation. However, many technical hurdles remain
    in developing a reliable and cost-effective, commercially-viable production system
    based on existing strains. The objective of this Phase II project is to provide
    a complete demonstration and pilot-scale operation of an API bioprocess that is
    ready for industrial scale up. The research employs four approaches: 1) Further
    development of the engineered yeast strains, 2) scale up of fermentation from
    laboratory scale to pilot scale, 3) optimization of downstream recovery and purification,
    and 4) evaluation of the resulting products to establish their validity as drop-in-replacements
    for existing opioid APIs. The outcome will be a process validated at pilot scale
    and ready for technology transfer to a secure industrial facility that will make
    and sell into the opioids API market. This research will replace opium poppies
    with a modern bioprocess that resembles established, standardized pharmaceutical
    industry methods for antibiotic and biologic APIs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses low student engagement through a dynamic video delivery environment with a novel, real-time algorithm that adjusts the instructional pathway to each student's readiness level. According to research, the greatest challenge facing teachers is overcoming the fact that between 25-66% of students are disengaged. Adapting instruction to each student's learning background has long been touted as the most effective method to drive student engagement; when instruction is individualized, engagement and outcomes increase dramatically. By calibrating video segments to student readiness, this project delivers appropriately challenging instruction to most effectively sustain engagement. Building on promising results in Phase I, the project aims to improve engagement and outcomes for all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students and, most pointedly, impacts English Language Learners (ELL) who often fall behind in STEM classes because instruction is beyond their readiness and in-class support is insufficient. Considering that ELL population is the fastest-growing population of public school students in the United States, this project has a significant potential to drive a STEM proficient workforce. Furthermore, given a strong, pre-existing client base, the project team is well positioned to penetrate the $110 million immediately addressable market. By 2020, the project team expects to be changing how 10% of U.S. middle schoolers absorb STEM instruction, opening a pathway to the adoption of powerful blended classroom techniques that enhance engagement, improve learning, and promote STEM careers.



    The core innovation is a research-founded algorithm to deliver appropriately complex instruction through all video segments. For successful delivery of appropriately complex instructional video segments, the project (1) measures student complexity readiness, (2) maintains a database of video segments categorized by complexity (using factors such as syntactic and lexical complexity), and (3) uniquely unifies that information to identify a real-time next step for that student (which video segment should be shown). The aim is to enhance outcomes by providing each student an appropriately complex instructional pathway forward. With roots in the leading interactive video solution, this project is made possible through access to a large database of tagged and curated videos (hundreds of thousands) and questions (millions) and provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop adaptive instructional pathways for a diverse learning spectrum. For Phase II, the project team's goal is to deploy a fully functioning classroom prototype of a product built around a middle school Physical Science unit and measure impact on engagement and learning. The team will employ stimulated recall interviewing techniques, speak aloud interview protocols, and quantitative usage logs to assess the feasibility of highly-adaptive video instruction to increase student engagement. Evaluation will include both formative components (to gauge implementation and iterative improvement) as well as summative components to assess impact on engagement and learning outcomes in a mixed-methods design including multiple pilot studies with control and experiment groups.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed to develop and commercialize an extendable/retractable telescopic structural wall for flood protection. This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Coastal cities and riverine communities are vulnerable to flooding hazards. These population centers tend to be located near bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general.  The commercial opportunity of the technology lies on the increasing worldwide need for flood protection. In fact, the World Bank estimates that 50 billion dollars a year will be spent worldwide in measures to mitigate this hazard. In U.S. only, floods are considered one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards with an estimated 7.9 billion dollars in damages and 82 fatalities per year. This technology, when developed, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by the ability of specimens to withstand the forces from three flooding scenarios representative of the targeted market sector: riverine, storm-surges and tsunamis. The Phase II project will focus on assessing the technical features of the walls based on lead-off customer sites. These will include the height of the walls, type of soil, and the hazard assessment, among others technical factors. Studies will be conducted on the local and overall structural response of the walls and the functionality of their mechanical components. Analytical and numerical models will be built and validated with tests on specific components and on full-scale models. The full-scale specimens will be subjected to storm-surges, hurricane, tsunami, slow-rising waters, and impacting debris forces. Robust theoretical framework along with analytical and numerical models and design guidelines will be built to reliably scale and replicate the technology for virtually any site where flood protection is needed.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses
    a new class of chemosensor films to continuously measure the concentration of
    heavy metals in a flowing stream of industrial wastewater. This will make it possible
    to know the concentration of several heavy metals at any given time so that treatment
    chemicals used to remove those metals can be metered precisely.  Current treatment
    methods typically rely on infrequent sampling of wastewater streams and time-delayed,
    labor-intensive laboratory measurements. Without the ability to measure continuously,
    wastewater treatment is adjusted based on periodic averages and estimated peak
    discharges.  To reduce the risk of regulatory violation, most wastewater treatment
    systems use twice the volume of treatment chemicals than might otherwise be needed.
    \ With the ability to measure metal concentrations continuously and automatically,
    wastewater treatment can be controlled in real time, cutting treatment chemical
    costs, solid waste costs and measurement labor costs by more than 50%.  Continuous
    measurement also reduces the risk of regulatory violations by > 90%, in turn reducing
    the potential costs of remediation and compliance as well as improving environmental
    conditions for the general public.     \n\nThe key outcome of Phase I research
    was the successful development of 15 new chemosensors permanently bound to a substrate,
    each with a unique response to zinc, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, lead, copper,
    iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel and tin. In Phase II, responses from
    an array of chemosensors will be fully characterized with a prototype instrument
    developed for commercial use in different industrial environments.  With that
    instrument, a mathematical model will be constructed to accurately convert sensor
    responses into scientific units of measure for multiple dissolved metals. The
    lower limit of detection for existing sensors ranges from 5 ppb to 50 ppb.  In
    parallel with analytical modeling work, chemosensor synthesis work continues to
    lower the limit of detection to 1 ppb, extend sensor life beyond 6 months, and
    broaden the portfolio of sensors to improve metal selectivity.  In the future,
    this new class of bonded chemosensors may be extended to determine the concentration
    of phosphates and many other species that are currently sampled occasionally and
    measured with lab instruments.  For applications where continuous measurement
    is important, this unique family of chemosensors offers great potential for real-time
    process control in a variety of industrial applications."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project stems from addressing the problem of embedded energy in the manufacture of magnesium metal for use in vehicle light-weighting. Improving fuel economy by incorporation of the lightest structural metal, magnesium, does not save on total lifecycle energy consumed if the magnesium was produced using conventional methods. The most energy efficient and economical production method is known is a process technology that was commercially viable during World War II but not at any other time in history. The project innovation reinvestigates and reinvents this dated process, discovering the reasons for technical and economic failure. Domestic magnesium production using state-of-the-art energy-efficient practices will lead to opportunity and growth for downstream manufacturers that support a wide range of military, industrial, and consumer products such as car parts, electronic devices, titanium and steel production, and canned beverages. The economic and environmental benefits of the innovation in the long term will be ever more prescient given the unprecedented rise in use of magnesium metal over the past 100 years. This innovation creates a clean and economic route to magnesium production, helping to reinvigorate light metals industries within the U.S.

    The intellectual merit of this project is derived from a new paradigm in the condensation of magnesium metal gas produced by carbothermal reduction of magnesium oxide. Previously, shock cooling through a meta-stable temperature range was employed, generating pyrophoric powders that are dangerous and difficult to handle. This Phase II research uses both rapid cooling and controlled heterogeneous condensation for the formation of robust, oxidation resistance magnesium condensate. This process is executed in a novel and continuous condenser for high metal throughput. This effort is also made possible through the development of a reduction reactor technology that operates under milder conditions than previously used while maintaining high production rates. Total plant energy consumption will be at least 50% less than the dominant incumbent process. The Phase II project will result in a scaled ore-to-ingot pilot facility for the manufacture of magnesium metal as a raw material into manufacturing processes. Product quality, process feasibility, and proven scale-up will be demonstrated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from technology for automatic network configuration analysis.  As ever more devices connect to the Internet and rich services move to the "cloud," both the complexity of computer networks and their reliability requirements are rapidly escalating. It is no wonder that network outages and security breaches are common.  Yet another side effect of this complexity, which does not make the headlines but is equally damaging, is that network engineers are understandably fearful of making configuration changes, so networks are unable to evolve at a speed that keeps up with changing business needs.  The technology developed in this project will enable network engineers to validate correctness, security, and performance properties of their networks proactively, before errors reach the running network.  This technology has the potential to improve the robustness of critical network infrastructure that is widely relied upon, to prevent unauthorized access to resources, and to increase the pace of innovation.  The project will also provide insights into the largest "pain points" in modern networks and develop design and analysis techniques to address them.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project further develops the Batfish network configuration analysis technology.  Interactions with pilot customers as well as many interviews with potential customers identified the needs of the marketplace and how the Batfish technology can best be adapted to meet those needs. As a result, the specific goal of this project is to seamlessly aid network engineers in validating network behavior during the policy design phase. Drawing inspiration from how software is developed today, the company will extend Batfish to support continuous integration of network configurations and develop a series of analyses that can find errors in network configurations with minimal input from the network engineers. The anticipated outcome of these research thrusts is a technology that allows network engineers to easily understand and gain confidence in their proposed network designs and to iterate these designs more quickly.   The project will be driven by continued interactions with several pilot customers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and apply machine learning statistical tools to Internet of Things (IoT) water delivery and water quality sensors. This will enable prediction and preemptive response to water point failures. The resilience of these environmental services is dependent upon credible and continuous indicators of reliability, leveraged by funding agencies to incentivize performance among service providers. In many locations, these service providers are utilities providing access to clean water, safe sanitation, and reliable energy. However, in some rural areas, there remains a significant gap between the intent of service providers and the impacts measured over time. Achieving the SBIR Phase II core objectives will help close the loop on effective and clean water delivery.  IoT sensors and services will address one of the most critical public health gaps by enabling delivery of reliable and safe water.

    IoT solutions for this environment may help address these information asymmetries and enable improved decisions and response. However, given the remote and power constrained environments and the high degree of variability between fixed infrastructure including age, materials, pipe diameters, power quality, rotating equipment vendors (pumps and generators), servicing, and functionality, any IOT solution would have to either be bespoke engineering, or compensate for these site-wise complexities through analytics. Instead, our SBIR II approach is to develop universal, solar powered cellular and satellite IOT hardware for each service type, and addresses site complexities through cloud-based sensor fusion and statistical learning. In this way, we significantly reduce hardware and logistical costs, and provide value to our customers through service delivery analytics. In Phase I, we demonstrated the application of simple sensors and sophisticated machine learning to identify off-nominal service delivery across a cohort of water pumps of various designs. We developed a universal electrical borehole sensor compatible with disparate fixed infrastructure, and we demonstrated solving the problem of heterogeneous customer hardware with a homogeneous sensor platform and adaptive machine learning backend.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is
    to develop precision-guided delivery of drugs or diagnostic compounds to the site
    of damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is quite common; every year, over
    10 million people worldwide injure their brain, and it is the most common cause
    of death and disability in young people. There are currently no drugs available
    that would limit the additional damage to the brain from swelling and inflammation
    after the injury or help repair the brain. The company's technology allows one
    to guide a drug to the injured brain and keep it there until it has done its job,
    while less of the drug goes to normal tissues. This way, it will be possible to
    use drugs that, while beneficial in brain injury, may do damage elsewhere. It
    also makes it possible to use new types of drugs that would otherwise not reach
    their target in the brain. If the company is successful in bringing this technology
    to the clinic, it may make brain injury victims better, and significant savings
    to the healthcare system may also be obtained. \n\nThe proposed project will develop
    a highly efficacious technology platform for site-specific delivery of drugs to
    acute brain injury. The main reasons for the failure of neuro-protective agents
    in clinical trials are lack of specificity and the dose limiting effects of the
    therapy. Targeted delivery can circumvent this problem. In Phase I, the company
    described a novel peptide, CAQK, which specifically delivers various types of
    payloads to sites of brain injury from systemic administration. Developing improved
    variants of this peptide with high affinity and stability is important in ensuring
    optimal clinical translation of this technology. The objective of this project
    is to optimize the delivery platform by exploring different modifications of the
    CAQK peptide, and to use high throughput screening of chemical compound libraries
    to search for compounds that reproduce the CAQK activity. The outcome of this
    Phase II application will be a panel of stable, long-circulating, high affinity
    peptides and/or small molecule chemical mimetics that can be used for targeted
    drug delivery to injured brain. The most promising compounds will be validated
    in animal models of brain injury. Transformative advances in brain injury treatment
    in the form of increased efficacy, reduced side effects, and ease of administration

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports the development of a technology to improve the way drugs are delivered in the body. Less than 2% of the dose of any medication finds its way to the place in the body where it is needed. The other 98% is either eliminated or, even worse, concentrates in areas where they can lead to side effects. This happens with all medications from daily anti-inflammatory drugs to the latest cancer therapies. If successful, this new approach will turn a regular drug into a medicine that is concentrated and activated only at the area where it is needed. This advance should increase the efficacy of the therapy and minimize its side effects. For example, the local drug activation can target chemotherapies to tumors with minimal side effects. Antibiotics could be delivered at higher local doses than is currently possible, eliminating local infections and limiting the creation of drug-resistant bacteria. Anti-inflammatory medications could be more powerful, improving the management of post-operative pain, potentially reducing the use and misuse of opioid drugs. Overall, this technology could reduce the costly burden of adverse drug events, estimated at more than $177 billion.

    To create targeted medicines, researchers rely on the endogenous differences between diseased tissue and the rest of the body (e.g., molecular markers or differences in enzymatic activity). Local drug activation provides a new path to create targeted medicines. The approach starts by injecting a biodegradable polymer at the desired site. The material contains exogenous chemical activators that do not exist anywhere else in the body. Then a drug is given systemically that is inactive until it comes in contact with the gel improving local efficacy and diminishing systemic side effects. Phase 1 results showed that an inactivated chemotherapy eliminated tumors in mice after only 10 days of therapy with minimal side effects. The Phase II project will expand the benefits of the local drug activation platform to other therapies, including cancer therapies and pain medications. The long-term goal is to show the applicability of the approach to multiple classes of drugs and increase their potential to improve outcomes for diseases that affect local areas of the body. If successful, this advance should enable medications for people who are too frail to receive them and enable therapies to work in combinations that were previously impossible due to dose-limiting toxicities.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase global access to vaccines
    and reduce mortality associated with infectious diseases. As an example, Rotavirus
    is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children and lack of vaccination
    results in 450,000 deaths annually. A thermostable rotavirus vaccine would create
    cost-savings for vaccine manufacturers, national governments, and non-profit vaccine
    buyers and enable market access in areas of the world that lack sufficient cold-chain
    capacity. Successful development of a stable rotavirus vaccine would not only
    have significant positive impact on global rotavirus immunization efforts, but
    may also revolutionize the general approach to vaccine delivery and distribution.
    This Phase II project will advance towards commercialization a novel platform
    technology that both stabilizes vaccines and enables novel delivery formats. This
    technology has significant commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied
    to numerous emerging and existing vaccines in the $24 Billion global market. \n\nThe
    proposed project seeks to leverage the unique properties of silk to meet the global
    need for robust, thermostable vaccines. Thermal instability is a long-standing
    problem in vaccine development. Despite efforts to improve stability, current
    formulation approaches do not allow product storage under ambient conditions.
    Temperature excursions during shipment and storage are common and result in wastage
    or administration of suboptimal vaccines. The use of silk fibroin, a low-cost

    the proposed research is to advance the silk-stabilization platform towards commercialization
    of vaccines that do not require cold storage. Building upon successful Phase I
    results, advanced formulation optimization studies will define a final product
    formulation for rotavirus that is compatible with scaled manufacturing and achieves
    all storage and in vivo attributes necessary for a commercial product. Through
    process optimization studies, fabrication of a dissolvable thin strip for oral
    delivery of rotavirus will be translated into a scalable manufacturing process

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a robust, in-line plasmonic sensor for the detection of mercury in natural gas. Mercury naturally contaminates natural gas at the parts per million levels and can corrode critical aluminum components in processing facilities. Heat exchangers at Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plants have failed catastrophically due to mercury corrosion, costing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and injuring workers.  Current monitoring methods cannot operate at the high pressures found in the process gas lines, leading to inaccurate measurements and unreliable instruments. LNG is a growing share of global energy as natural gas replaces more carbon intensive fossil fuels. By 2020, 30 LNG plants will be operating world wide, for a total mercury monitoring market of $136 million. Mercury monitoring at petrochemical facilities broadly is a $216 million per year market.  Mercury itself is a neurotoxin and a global pollutant; our sensor has the potential to aid in efforts to detect and remove mercury before it can impact human health. Beyond mercury, plasmonic sensing is a novel technology with applications for a variety of chemical and biological species.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the utilization of a novel sensing platform based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of a gold nanoparticle film. It will build upon the success of the Phase I project, which demonstrated the suitability of LSPR sensors for the detection of elemental mercury vapor. This Phase II project will proceed along two objectives. The first objective will be to adapt the sensor for operations at high pressure; included in this objective is the redesign of key components of the system and the construction of a high-pressure test bench.  The second objective is testing the LSPR sensor in a natural gas matrix; preliminary results indicate that LSPR mercury sensors response well in methane, but the full range of response and lifetime performance will be investigated in this project. Upon completion of these two objectives, field trials will commence. The full system will be certified for use in a gas plant and demonstrated at a suitable natural gas plant. A commercial prototype LSPR based natural gas mercury monitor will be realized upon completion of this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a commercial implementation of holographic video microscopy, a fast, precise and flexible technology for measuring the properties of individual colloidal particles suspended in fluid media. This disruptive technology solves critical manufacturing problems across industries that work with colloidal dispersions.  Demonstrated applications include: 1) monitoring the growth of nanoparticle agglomerates in precision slurries used to polish semiconductor wafers where scratches due to slurry agglomerates are responsible for waste valued at $1 billion annually; 2) tracking concentrations of dangerous contaminants in wastewater streams; and 3) measuring the concentration of protein aggregates in biopharmaceuticals, a safety concern noted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in this $250 billion industry.  Holographic video microscopy is unique among particle-characterization technologies in providing comprehensive information about the size, shape and composition of individual particles in real time and in situ. Having access to this wealth of data facilitates product development, creates new opportunities for process control and provides a new tool for quality assurance across a broad spectrum of industries enabling safer, less expensive products for consumers while providing cost savings to manufacturers.

    The technical objectives of this project are: 1) to optimize the design of the underlying holographic microscopy system without compromising the quality of results; 2) to enable quantitative concentration determination including corrections for perturbations introduced by flow dynamics; 3) to expand the domain of operation to characterize non-spherical particles and 4) to apply machine-learning algorithms for automated robust operation.  Using holographic video microscopy for commercial applications requires adaptation and innovation in the design of the prototype instrument that was used to demonstrate feasibility. Streamlining the optical train will require advanced modeling and the creation of new methods of correcting optical aberrations to enable ease of manufacture. Additional improvements in design will include advances in improving microfluidic flow control to generate accurate concentration determination, to adapt holographic analysis algorithms for characterizing the structure of aspheric particles, and to extend analytical capabilities for turbid fluids. Finally, innovative machine-learning using neural network algorithms demonstrated significant improvements for analytical robustness in Phase I and will be extended to a wider range of applications. The Phase II effort will enable holographic video microscopy of real-world samples with typical measurement times of a few minutes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes new ways to inform, educate, advertise or entertain through a technology called projection mapping. This technology uses commodity video projectors to augment the surfaces of ordinary objects; applications range from advertising, events, and entertainment, to educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, and simulation (e.g. military or employee training). Through multiple deployments at retail locations across the country, the company's prototypes have demonstrated that these applications will benefit not only the brands and companies that employ the technology, but also the end-users (students, consumers, etc), resulting in better engagement and faster learning when compared to achieving these same tasks through other media such as videos. Research performed during the Phase II project will allow the company to develop a scalable product and fulfill many deployments, bringing projection mapping to new markets. A free version of the company's software will also be available for non-commercial and academic use, enabling interdisciplinary research in fine arts and computer science. The R&D results generated from the research will be published and disseminated to the public.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a commercially viable and scalable projection mapping system. While projection mapping has a long academic history, this captivating medium still remains out of commercial reach. As learned from over 50 customer discovery interviews, retailers are shifting towards location-based experiences to increase customer engagement and sales. Many other industries have a similar need to attract attention and convey information, but without a scalable product that can be easily deployed and maintained, they lack the means to provide these experiences. To address this need, the company will develop hardware and software systems to enable captivating and immersive projection mapping experiences. The core of this system is in software: the developed algorithms will robustly calibrate projection mapping systems comprising any number of projectors/cameras, automatically align projected content to the scene and perform color-correction when the display surfaces are non-white/textured. These algorithms will be validated through standard benchmarks, resulting in novel, state-of-the-art practices. Additionally, these methods will allow for reusable projection mapping content, a critical feature lacking in existing software, as well as cloud deployment and monitoring. New hardware configurations will also be developed to achieve new uses for projection mapping.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is its potential to revolutionize human-machine interfaces, with possible applications in computer-aided design (CAD); military, maintenance, and pilot training interfaces; industrial and construction operator interfaces; robotic and laparoscopic surgery; physical therapy, rehabilitation, and swing training; education; telerobotics; automotive navigation and safety systems; and video games. While haptic interactions in these applications can already be portrayed with desktop robotic force feedback devices, the developed haptic technology could provide realistic haptic feedback at a much lower price point (required for consumer devices) and unlike current force feedback devices, the developed haptic devices can be used to naturally interact in large workspace applications like motion-input video games or VR experiences. The proposed research will enhance the scientific understanding of human-haptic and multi-modal interactions in virtual environments, and will create a model for this technology to migrate into adjacent fields.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to meet the market demand for intuitive, immersive, and inexpensive haptic technologies in the emerging field of consumer virtual reality (VR). Multiple companies are now making inexpensive 3D head-mounted displays (HMDs) for VR, but current haptic interfaces are either too expensive, have limited range of motion, or are too crude to portray realistic haptic interactions in VR. The company has created an ungrounded haptic motion controller that utilizes a new form of touch feedback that applies in-hand shear forces to create compelling physical feedback at a price that is viable for consumer markets. The proposed research objectives are based on feedback from key stakeholders and VR enthusiasts who have tried the company?s current high-end haptic controllers. Their feedback suggests improving the overall user experience of the controllers through reducing device size, mass, and system latency, while improving device ergonomics and reducing cost. The Phase II research builds on the findings of Phase I, which showed that even simpler implementations of the newly developed haptic technology were still found to be more compelling than traditional vibration feedback. The project will result in a reference design that can be mass produced.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in the field of healthcare.  The United States spends approximately $9,000 per person per year on healthcare.  Ultrasound medical imaging is a medical imaging technology that could lower costs by providing an alternative to higher-cost imaging techniques.  The technology created during this Phase II project is expected to increase the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound, which would in turn reduce medical imaging costs in the US healthcare system.  Furthermore, the company's technology is expected to bring ultrasound to more clinical settings and improve system-wide efficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.  The technology also has commercial potential in the international market, with $5.8B spent annually on medical ultrasound devices worldwide.  Finally, by improving the utility of ultrasound, the technology will lead to improved patient care and may ultimately save lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop deep learning technology for ultrasound imaging in medicine.  Ultrasound imaging has numerous benefits including real-time image acquisition, non-invasive scanning, low-cost devices, and no known side-effects (it is non-ionizing).  However, variability in quality has encumbered its adoption and utility.  As a result, more expensive imaging is typically utilized, often exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  Our objective is to develop, improve, and test machine learning techniques, based on deep learning, to improve ultrasound acquisition and interpretation.  We expect this project will create novel technologies that make ultrasound easier to use and improve the quality of ultrasound examinations.  The end result will improve the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound examinations, will result in cost savings to the healthcare system, will produce improvements in patient care, and will support a sustainable business opportunity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of technology for the intracellular delivery of biomolecules directly into cells. This microfluidics-based platform has the potential to become an enabling technology for intracellular delivery, which may be used to accelerate drug discovery R&D by allowing reliable, efficient delivery of diverse material classes without having to engineer the material or the cell to natively uptake these molecules. Such capabilities could allow pharmaceutical companies to assess the efficacy of drug candidates faster than ever before, especially with integration into high-throughput robotic workflows that are already well-established and efficacious. The technology could dramatically reduce the time to market for new drugs by decoupling determination of a candidate's activity from the cell's affinity for the molecule. It also could facilitate a deeper understanding of biological processes and pathways. Initial studies with leading drug developers and academic laboratories towards this goal have been very encouraging, and, in the future, the platform could potentially enable robust engineering of cell function for cell-based therapies targeting a diversity of diseases including influenza, cancer, and even autoimmune disorders.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes the continued development of the intracellular delivery technology to address relevant applications in drug discovery R&D. New drug discovery is often hampered by the inability of membrane-impermeable drug candidates to enter the cell cytosol, necessitating exogenous materials for delivery such as strong electric fields or viral vectors. However, these materials tend to cause off-target effects or toxicity, presenting a need for a technology that can facilitate delivery without altering post-treatment cellular function. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a platform geared towards market adoption of microfluidic hardware as the standard method for transfection and intracellular delivery. During Phase II, the platform will be fully-characterized, validated, and verified in order to produce the consistent, repeatable results necessary to achieve market entry. In addition, research is planned to demonstrate the ability of the platform to support drug discovery R&D by developing the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for use with this intracellular delivery technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable the availability of a revolutionary manufacturing process for pharmaceuticals. The project consists of the development of novel process technologies, as well as the integration of these processes into an end-to-end continuous manufacturing line that can produce drugs continuously (24/7 basis). This is different from the current methodology that produces large quantities of drugs at discrete time points (e.g. large batch quantities are produced several times a year).  A working pilot plant of this process demonstrated significant operational advantages with a marketed drug-production time was reduced from 200 days to 2 days, plant footprint decreased by 90%, projected costs reduced by 50%, while improving product quality.  The impact on society will be considerable: patients will receive better quality drugs; drug shortages will be greatly reduced; and pharmaceutical companies will be able to manufacture and distribute their drugs in a much more cost-effective and efficient manner, allowing them to reallocate more capital to Research and Development (new drugs developed).  Finally, it will be possible to relocate manufacturing plants and jobs back in the U.S. (more efficient processes = lower costs).

    The proposed project builds upon a successful Phase I SBIR project, as well as five years of collaboration between a premier research institution and a leading pharmaceutical company aimed at developing a novel continuous manufacturing process to overcome the limitations of the current standard, batch manufacturing.  The first objective of this NSF project is to further develop two novel elements of a multistep, continuous manufacturing process (i.e. heterogeneous crystallization and electrospinning for solid dosage forms), so they run reliably under different operating conditions. This is important because commercial production requires that they perform consistently and reliably 24/7. Thus, these novel unit operations will be studied under different operating conditions and starting materials, while their design is optimized.  Success will be defined when the unit operations achieve: 1) maximal operational efficiency, 2) industry standard manufacturing capabilities, and 3) qualification to be used across the Research and Development manufacturing spectrum.  The second objective is to integrate these two units into a broader end-to-end continuous manufacturing process capable of producing high-quality pharmaceuticals on a continuous basis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for a more effective glaucoma treatment by adjusting eye pressure based on disease progression for each patient. In 2015, the US glaucoma market is estimated to be over $2 billion and our addressable market, glaucoma surgical therapies, is estimated to be $534M. The incidence for glaucoma increases with age, and as the baby boomer population gets older, there will be a growing need for glaucoma treatments. To treat glaucoma, patients undergo lifelong drug regimens, multiple laser procedures, and invasive surgical procedures. However, even with all these treatment options glaucoma patients still go blind from glaucoma. The proposed novel design and approach to glaucoma will personalize the treatment for patients and remove the need for numerous and costly procedures. Most importantly, the personalization of glaucoma therapy will optimize visual protection for every patient.

    The proposed project will validate the safety and efficacy of a glaucoma drainage device to adjust and set pressure in the eye. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and is only treatable by reducing eye pressure. Surgical treatments are unpredictable with suboptimal success rates based primarily on the choice of drainage site. The proposed novel device drains to a new area of the eye to avoid the complications and unpredictability associated with the current glaucoma surgeries. The device also can provide the first-ever personalized treatment for millions of glaucoma sufferers by fine-tuning pressure based on the needs of the patient throughout his or her lifetime. Phase I/IB studies have shown feasibility of the device with an adjustable component.  However, its efficacy and safety have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, in this Phase II research grant, we will optimize the device for safety and efficacy and perform the necessary preclinical testing according to FDA standards to further develop the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a new analytical chemistry instrument for rapid quantitation of residual chemical impurities in complex mixtures. The target application for this project is the detection of genotoxic impurities during early drug development in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The instrument to be developed uses Fourier transform molecular rotational resonance (FT-MRR) spectroscopy to identify molecules based on their three dimensional geometry, which permits high chemical specificity.  FT-MRR is a high-resolution spectroscopy technique that makes it possible to directly analyze gas mixtures containing a large number of chemicals without the need for prior chemical separation using chromatography - a time-consuming step of current analysis methods that requires significant technical supervision.  As a result, FT-MRR based chemical analysis instruments have the potential to speed up innovation for pharmaceutical manufacturers by reducing analytical development cycles from weeks to hours during the high-throughput drug innovation process.  Chemical analysis instruments using FT-MRR spectroscopy enable faster innovation in research and development labs with the added benefit of seamless method transferability to on-line process monitoring applications and routine quality control for final product release.

    The ability to transfer analysis methods into routine analysis is important to the industry goal of continuous manufacturing for pharmaceuticals.  It is enabled for FT-MRR in part (yet critically) by the two main objectives of this Phase II effort: the development of sampling automation for FT-MRR and the design of a cost-reduced, targeted FT-MRR system.  Concepts for both of these designs were successfully tested during Phase I.  The intellectual merit of this project is the introduction of a new technique for chemical analysis that senses chemicals based on the absolute molecular structure, with no orthogonal analysis required.  FT-MRR spectral fingerprints can distinguish molecular isomers, conformers, isotopologues, and even enantiomers.  With this kind of absolute structure information, FT-MRR can enable new studies that trace chemical pathways with site-specific isotopic ratio information and chiral detection.  Both concepts are otherwise very challenging with current technology.  The FT-MRR instrument to be built for this project combines recent advances in high-power, solid-state millimeter wave (mm-wave) light sources, low-cost microwave synthesizer integrated circuits, and high-speed digital electronics to implement a time-domain, Fourier transform (FT) measurement approach.  Standard methods for chemical sampling will be integrated to maximize the ease-of-use and robustness of FT-MRR instruments.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce the cost of solar generated electricity
    by increasing the efficiency of panels and reducing cleaning and maintenance costs.
    This improvement is created using a nanoscale glass coating that increases transmittance
    of single side coated solar PV glass and creates an antifogging and self-cleaning
    surface.  These savings increase with photovoltaic device efficiencies as well,
    so as the next generation of solar cells will see even greater benefit from the
    proposed innovation. Reducing the cost per watt of solar generated electricity
    is one of the grand energy challenges and has immense societal and governmental
    impacts. The proposed project is one component of addressing that challenge. The
    technical advances made in this project will also be applicable to additional
    market opportunities in LED lighting and other cutting-edge markets.\t\n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the deposition
    of water-based nanoparticle solutions using industrially scalable methods and
    results in valuable scientific knowledge that is not currently available in the
    field. Nanoparticle-based antireflective glass coatings have been presented in
    both the scientific literature and commercial products. However, most coatings
    suffer from either high deposition costs, or a trade-off between durability and
    performance. In this project, methods to increase the durability of a low-cost,
    high-performance nanoparticle that were developed in the Phase I project are scaled
    to high throughput and low cost fabrication methods. The process/structure/property
    relationships of this novel coating will be investigated and lead to new scientific
    knowledge related to the large-scale deployment of nanoparticle based technologies.
    The coated glass will be subjected to industry standard reliability and durability
    tests. The expected outcome of this work is the demonstration of this technology
    at a pilot level with industry collaborators."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the significant improvement of
    surgical accuracy, which will dramatically reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and
    reduce healthcare costs. In spine surgery alone, there are more than 500,000
    procedures every year in the US utilizing implants such as screws. In 4% to 11% of
    these surgeries, the implant placement is inaccurate. For the patient this translates into
    longer recoveries - from days to weeks - and in many cases into a second revision
    surgery. The patient is non-productive, unable to carry out their daily routines for weeks,
    while the healthcare system has to absorb the costs of the longer recovery as well as
    the revision surgeries. For both the healthcare and economic systems these are
    avoidable costs. The medical imaging technology being developed in this project has
    the potential to eliminate surgical inaccuracies across the $2.4B market of image
    guidance, improving clinical applications that range from orthopedic surgery to minimally
    invasive vascular interventions, to cancer diagnosis and treatments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will demonstrate a
    novel imaging modality, which provides near-real-time 3D live imaging - 4D - during
    surgery. This novel system will provide surgical imaging at a lower x-ray dose than
    fluoroscopy (current standard), with a geometry that allows concurrent imaging with
    surgery. This 4D technology has the potential to significantly reduce surgical
    inaccuracies, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Phase 1 successfully demonstrated
    the feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm used by the proposed imaging modality by
    showing its potential of higher surgical accuracy in a single spinal screw insertion. This
    Phase 2 project will I) prove the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm across a
    variety of use-cases, II) demonstrate the clinical usability of the 4D scanner, and III)
    confirm the clinical utility of the scanner. The clinical usability will be studied with an
    ergonomic model in a surgical setting. The clinical utility will be proven by building a
    system prototype and performing image quality and x-ray dose comparisons versus
    fluoroscopy and 3D in a realistic surgical setting. Preliminary results show that these
    objectives are achievable. This research is readying the technology for clinical research,
    regulatory clearance and commercialization.

    treatment system to allow produced water in the oil and gas industry to be effectively
    treated, thereby allowing its safe discharge to surface waters or recycling to
    stimulate production in new wells, rather than being disposed of in injection
    wells. Produced water is the water brought to the surface, with or without hydraulic
    fracturing, along with the intended fuel products during extraction of oil, gas,
    and coal bed methane from formations underground. In general, produced water is
    contaminated with hydrocarbons, salts, and harmful microorganisms, meaning that

    purposes. This is an important environmental, public safety, and economic problem
    in the US. Research conducted during this project will be used to evaluate reactor
    improvements including process sensors and control systems, electrode geometries
    and surface coatings, degradation of contaminants in produced water, field testing,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop instrumentation that will allow researchers to elucidate fundamental interactions at the atomic scale that occur at high-temperature and various timescales.  From advanced automobile manufacturing to computer chips, virtually all developing technologies require processing materials at high temperatures to enhance their properties.  The proposed optical delivery system will enable researchers and manufacturers to efficiently study materials at unprecedented temperature, time, and length scales, and thus bring new products to market faster.  Furthermore, the system will provide engineers and scientists a new platform for rapidly advancing emerging technologies that are limited by understanding high-temperature and excited-state materials phenomena.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design, assemble and test an optical delivery system specifically suitable for nano- and atomic-scale characterization in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The proposed program will deliver a system with unprecedented ability to efficiently stimulate materials in the TEM via highly-localized photothermal and photoexcited modalities. The photothermal modality will enable agile, non-invasive, and ubiquitous access to TEM specimens, and enable studies of unique temperature and temporal regimes not accessible using standard resistive heating systems. The proposed integrated temperature measurement system will allow closed-loop feedback and control of the precise temperature. The excitation modality will enable researchers to image and characterize optically excited states of materials at the nanoscale. The proposed instrumentation consists of fiber-coupled optical heating and excitation channels positioned by a specially-designed nanomanipulator for accurate x-y-z positioning. In addition to the hardware development, appropriate software controls will be developed for the optical sources and the nanomanipulator system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide accurate indoor location services to users via existing mobile electronic devices like smartphones and tablets. This technology will bring many of the applications powered by GPS, like navigation, tracking and location-based advertising to indoor markets. We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based beaconing system to enable sub-20cm location accuracy within large, GPS-denied environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-harvesting instead of requiring expensive electrical wiring. Accurate indoor location-aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail, healthcare and manufacturing, all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the visually impaired.

    The proposed project aims to develop a robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost radio frequency (RF) tags to better than 20cm accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS. Current indoor localization technologies for smartphones often fall short in terms of accuracy, especially in highly dynamic environments with obstructions. Our system utilizes energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and technologies required to streamline installation to support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require tens to hundreds of beacons. This involves the development of a mapping and commissioning system as well as hardware beacon modules for integration of our technology into the products of third parties (e.g. smart camera systems, building sensors, etc). We will also integrate the ability to track tagged assets.

    The wheel will exhibit the blending of multiple shapes in one design including
    a sine wave, cube, circle and hexagon. It will be approximately 4.5 feet tall,
    and weighing approximately 400lbs for use in the farming industry. The concept
    is to create two wheels in tandem where the sine waves are out-of-phase from one
    another. The front wheel would create a left-right-left path into the soil, much
    like the path a snake would leave behind traversing soil. The rear wheel would
    move in an opposite right-left-right configuration leaving a double helix footprint

    has already been scientifically proven on a smaller scale in the skateboarding
    industry to reduce friction, increase longevity, increase off-road ability, and
    increase speed. Multiple wheel iterations will be manufactured and subsequently

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project focuses on litter - one of the world's
    most pervasive and toxic problems. To many, it's dirty, disgusting, and someone
    else's problem to solve. Unfortunately, we all suffer the consequences, as litter
    impacts our economy, degrades the environment, demoralizes community pride, kills
    wildlife, and poisons the food system. This project builds on the accomplishments
    of an SBIR Phase I project that developed a mobile technology empowering anyone
    to identify, map, and collect the world's litter, while simultaneously connecting
    to a broader community of associated brands, cities, schools. \n\n\nThe company
    has integrated image recognition and machine learning algorithms into its software
    to advance the crowdsourcing of litter data and cleanup activities. This advancement
    will allow for the identification of litter even if the item is in a deep state
    of decay and decomposition. This project also aims to continue building the Global
    Database of Litter, a technology platform that integrates the company's litter
    taxonomic classification with other data sets including location, time, retail
    locations, and the watershed. This data provides great potential to improve municipal
    infrastructure, resource allocation, brand packaging redesign, and individual
    responsibility that promotes positive behavioral change. Like the National Science
    Foundation, this project aims to promote the progress of science and advance our
    national health, prosperity, and welfare.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

- abstractText: "Fuel burned for industrial process heat accounts for 20%-30% of all
    carbon emissions on the face of the earth. Yet no emissions-free solutions for
    process heat are commonly available today. Thermal energy requires burning fuel.
    Beyond the impact to local air quality and climate change, the need for fuel creates
    energy poverty both domestically and abroad. When fuel supplies are threatened,
    it can endanger the livelihoods of those that depend on the fuel.\nThe impact
    of Skyven?s solution is to turn the sun into a viable, practical source of high
    temperature thermal energy. It has the potential to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions,
    improve local air quality, reduce energy poverty, and diversify America?s energy
    supply. Just a single Skyven project of 500 collectors will offset 29,900 gallons
    of diesel fuel, equivalent to planning 4,400 trees. Skyven envisions doing thousands
    of projects across the USA and tens of thousands across the globe. One day IMA
    technology may even enable rural areas and developing nations to leapfrog natural
    gas distribution infrastructure in the same way that cellphones have leapfrogged
    landlines. This project is an opportunity for the United States to take a leadership
    role in technology to enable these societal changes.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project will address a key barrier to solar thermal deployment
    in the industrial sector: lack of an effective interface to connect high temperature
    solar thermal system with legacy fuel-fired thermal systems.  Existing interfaces
    are limited to low temperatures (below 100?C) and utilize costly plumbing schemes
    that are prone to failure. They suffer from poor reliability and create severe
    maintenance headaches, rendering them unusable in the industrial sector.  These
    systems also typically require the host facility to be take offline during installation
    ? an costly sacrifice in the industrial sector.  The temperature limitations are
    particularly problematic, as many industrial facilities operate high temperatures
    condensate return systems that rarely drop below 100?C.  \nSkyven?s system-level
    innovations solve these challenges, making its high temperature solar thermal
    collectors a practical and financially-attractive option for industries such as
    food processing.  Phase II research will implement two innovations in particular:
    (1) solar steam injection into a traditional fuel-fired boiler; and (2) wireless
    control with automated optical calibration/commissioning algorithms and failsafe
    stagnation/overheat protection. In addition, the project will prove out high temperature
    operation up to 200C, both in outdoor laboratory-scale testbed and later in a
    real-world industrial facility.  It will also utilize advanced reliability engineering
    concepts to show long-term (20 year) reliability without requiring unlimited test
    time and testing resources.  The project will also advance knowledge in the space
    of industrial controls engineering, showing that new industrial systems can be
    integrated with existing controls through innovative controls interfacing, without
    require rework of the existing control systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project supports development of a commercially
    viable real time optical imaging device to address the problem of failed first
    time vascular access.  Peripheral IV access (PIV) is the most common invasive
    procedure for all ages, races and clinical settings. In the United States alone,
    there are an estimated 230 million PIVs placed per year. First time IV access
    has a shockingly high failure rate of 35%-50%.  Multiple attempts result in pain
    and emotional distress, especially in the pediatric population where the failure
    rate is highest. The average cost of placing an IV on the first time is $69.76.
    \ Three or more attempts doubles the cost to be greater than $125 per IV. When
    PIV access cannot be obtained the more invasive, risky and costly central IV access
    is used which increases the risk of blood borne infections as well as other complications.
    One central IV sourced infection can add 7-20 additional days of hospital length
    of stay and $56,000 of additional (unreimbursed) cost, adding as much as $2.3
    billion in increased US intensive care unit costs each year.  These failure rates
    occur even though ultrasound and near infrared devices are available to improve
    first time IV access. \n\nIn phase II, the project team will refine the hybrid
    Optical Coherence Tomography tipped imaging probe, customized for vascular access,
    and integrate it into a commercially viable system to fulfill goals not supported
    by any other imaging system: finding and recognizing veins; guiding the angiocath
    needle to the vein; acquiring intra lumen access on first attempt; and confirming
    intra lumen placement.  The system needs to be cost effective, durable and acceptable
    to a multitude of diverse clinicians. The disposable adapter probe will connect
    to a hand piece that will tactilely enable the clinician to actuate rotation and
    advancement of the optical probe to acquire data necessary to create clinically
    relevant 3D real time images.  The data are transmitted to a control unit for
    processing and then presented to a small form display such as smart phone. Research
    activity will be focused in developing the egonomically acceptable hand piece
    that does not interfere with  variable angular approaches to the vein. A critical
    part of the ongoing research will focus on software design for creating an optimal
    graphic user interface (GUI). Multiple form factors of the hand piece, the GUI,
    and visual display will be evaluated by practicing clinicians for final production.\n\nThis

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide the $4B/year cover lens market an economically viable material for the upcoming form-factor it must address: foldable displays. While this market size currently represents displays that employ rigid LCD or OLED technologies, major handset manufacturers are looking to move to highly differentiated form-factors such as foldable phones to gain market share in the competitive flagship smartphone tier. To do so, the entire display module must be foldable and one of the last components to allow for this behavior is the cover lens. Foldable displays therefore must eliminate hard, brittle materials such as glass and utilize materials with the same excellent scratch-resistant properties of glass, but with the flexibility and durability under folding of polymers. This project develops a novel polysulfide thermoset for this application.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop the first low-cost, high-performance foldable cover lens technology using polysulfide thermosetting polymer films. Currently, the amorphous polysulfide thermosets can yield the excellent optical properties and folding durability required for application in foldable display technologies. However, these materials are as of yet unable to meet the strict hardness requirement set by manufacturers looking to replace rigid glass cover lenses. In this work, the expansion of the polysulfide thermoset family of materials will be undertaken to introduce chemical and physical modifications which allow for the resultant thermosetting films to possess the requisite hardness. The resultant resin materials will then be converted using standard wet-film extrusion and curing tools commonly found in the printing industry, allowing for cost-competitive production of the resulting films.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide farmers with a new class of biotechnology-based pesticides for more affordable and environmentally benign crop production by addressing an unmet need: an efficacious, selective and safe pesticide. The project will focus on a pesticide for the diamondback moth (DBM), a pest that damages Brassica crops such as canola, cabbage, cauliflower and collards.  It is the most costly invasive crop pest worldwide, for which there is no effective solution with acceptable resistance management.  DMB has developed resistance to more than 90 active ingredients in conventional insecticides, i.e., almost every insecticide class known. If successful, this biotechnology platform will contribute to sustainable food production and enhanced biodiversity with minimal use of non-selective traditional pesticides associated with human health costs.  The goal is to develop a product that is efficacious, selective, and provides improved resistance management against field populations of DMB.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of RNAi-based pesticide for the treatment of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) infestations in cruciferous crops.  In the last five years, there have been significant advances in the methods for the production of RNAi triggers that allow the manufacturing of these materials in large quantities and at a low price, which is required for broad agricultural applications. Topical RNAi-based pesticides have been demonstrated in the lab to be very selective with respect to the intended target. They also may be readily modified to combat developed pesticide resistance by target pests. However, due to low efficacy at economically attractive application rates, very few pests and no Lepidopteran insects are currently in the RNAi list of commercial targets. This project specifically addresses the challenges related to RNAi efficacy, and the development of the proposed technology could be applied to Lepidopteran control and other biotechnology applications. The outcome of the proposed research would provide the first example of a scalable RNAi-based insecticide targeting Plutella xylostella or any Lepidopteran.

    This SBIR Phase II project demonstrates and clinically validates a novel, non-invasive imaging technology to detect diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of vision loss in the world. This devastating complication of both type I and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation have been shown to be a reliable indicator of diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of detecting these small functional changes, a major need exists for new retinal oximetry technologies. Diabetic retinopathy affects 200 million people worldwide. The American Diabetes Association reports that the cost of diabetes in the US in 2012 was $245 billion, including $69 billion in reduced productivity and $176 billion in medical costs. Since 40% of diabetics are anticipated to develop diabetic retinopathy, the estimated economic cost of diabetic retinopathy is $98 billion annually. By mitigating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy, this technology will help reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy treatment, its overall economic burden, and help save the vision of millions of people around the world.

    The primary technical innovation behind the proposed technology is its use of a novel physics-based model to overcome the challenges of high-resolution retinal imaging. These challenges include the multi-layered structure of the retina, absorbance dynamics, and the need to produce an image in one snapshot to reduce motion artifacts. Compared with existing methods based on structural imaging, the successful outcome of this project will become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. The development of the technology proceeds through iterative optimization between laboratory and real-use environments to generate robust, validated data. Specifically, in Phase II, the research objectives of the project are pursued in two parallel tracks: 1) refinement of the core imaging system, and 2) validation using model and human subjects in a clinical environment. The outcome of this project will be an easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology with proven clinical utility in detecting the onset of diabetic retinopathy based on functional properties, before structural damage has occurred in the patient.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that unplanned outages of power generation gas turbines are increasingly occurring which pose a risk of $1.6 billion to gas turbine manufacturers across an average fleet of 500 annually on power services contracts. Using these sensors to measure blade surface temperatures will replace the significant cost of unplanned outages, by revealing when combustors are over firing to enable operators to take corrective measures. According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, power generation gas turbines accounted for 1.3 million tons of NOx and SOx emissions. NOx emissions are increased due to erroneous combustor firing. This project would also lead to acceleration of adoption for developmental engines owing to reduced cost and labor requirements associated with measurement instrumentation installation. Also, this can be used in monitoring harsh environment parameters in remotely inaccessible locations, while providing insight to control systems increasing the efficiency of systems in nuclear reactors and chemical processing plants.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a polymer-derived ceramics (PDC) sensor system for gas turbine engine's blade surface temperature measurement. Currently, no sensors exist that can survive these harsh environments in-situ. This innovation combines unique, wireless, passive, corrosion-resistant PDC-based resonators bonded directly on the blade surface along with high temperature PDC-based antenna for operating in harsh environments. The research objectives are to miniaturize & optimize the sensor utilizing  different PDCs; fabrication & validation of high temperature antenna; characterization of PDC material properties, microstructural changes, degradation of sensing performance, bonding mechanism evaluation after long term exposure to high temperatures (~1000C) in a furnace & burner rig. The prototype, including integrated multiple sensors, high temperature antenna & user data interface, will be operated on a rotating micro-turbine to demonstrate performance in actual operating environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project relates to the notion of distributed manufacturing using 3D printing, where structural parts may be manufactured onsite, meeting on-demand needs while eliminating transportation costs and inventory storage.  Unique, one-off prints, such as may often occur in the medical industry are another virtue of 3D print technology.  For these reasons, virtually every major US manufacturing industry is exploring avenues to utilize 3D printing.  While 3D printing is unquestionably entering the mainstream of manufacturing technology, a glaring gap in advancing the industry is the simulation of the performance of an "as manufactured" part.  A common question surrounding 3D print manufacturing today is: "How do I know if my part will perform as envisioned?" The proposed technology brings an industry leading software simulation to the product engineer and designer to answer this very question, enabling engineers to predict part performance, prior to attempting a build. The speed and simplicity of the software solution is transformative, accelerating the adoption of this disruptive manufacturing technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the technical challenge of predicting structural performance of an "as manufactured" fiber-reinforced 3D printed part. Additive Manufacturing (AM) offers the product engineer or designer tremendous freedom to create parts not achievable by more traditional processes.  However, parts produced by AM are fundamentally different than those produced by conventional methods.  For example, a machined aluminum part is largely homogenous, while a 3D printed part allows for internal lattice (infill) structures.  A 3D printed part can also exhibit a multitude of process anomalies such as voids, delamination between layers, warping produced by residual stresses as the part cools, and, in the case of fiber filled plastics, fiber orientation that varies throughout the part.  Collectively, these features can have a dramatic impact on the ultimate performance of the part and must be understood by the engineer early in the design stage.  This project seeks to develop a commercial software simulation product that predicts the structural performance of a part produced by 3D printing, while optimizing the infill (lattice) structure for strength and weight. Speed, simplicity, and high-fidelity results are hallmarks of the proposed solution and are at the core of the value proposition.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will allow highly cost effective, 2-way communications to be delivered to machinery and 'Things' over extremely long and non-line-of-sight distances using underutilized frequencies and new hardware and software techniques. The resulting technologies will provide 2-way connectivity where cellular does not exist and where other techniques (Satellite) are too expensive. This will result in near universal availability of the Internet-of-Things at costs superior to legacy approaches and which are appropriate for applications typically seen in Internet-of-Things applications. Further, the work will have broad impact in allowing more balanced utilization of the radio spectrum which cannot be addressed (either economically or at all) with legacy wireless techniques.

    The proposed project will create a new system of hardware, software, frequency and operating techniques which will allow underutilized spectrum to be used to deliver 2-way communications to very remote machines and things. The work will build on our Phase I accomplishments to create production-ready designs of two new wireless systems, signal processing software to allow use of challenging spectrum while avoiding existing users, create the first instance of a cloud based infrastructure for automated control and coordination of our architecture, and, the creation of a basic set of deployment tools and techniques to support field operations. We expect to continue building a significant base of Intellectual Property as we pursue the work.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the technology provides health care systems with a very accurate view of what their patients experience during health care encounters - what is going well and importantly, what specific problems are frustrating patients. With this insight, providers are able to quickly and efficiently resolve issues. Patients are increasingly active in deciding where they receive care.  As health care spending declines, providers find themselves competing for patients. To attract patients and drive market share, health systems must deliver not just excellent clinical care but also positive patient experiences.  Patients that have a negative health care encounter often choose to go elsewhere.  When they do, providers lose margin.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the industry need for better insight on how to quickly and efficiently improve patient experiences.  Surveys which are the norm in health care fail to deliver service failure details.  The company's software goes beyond current text analysis solutions by automating the classification of patient feedback based on the ideas and sentiment expressed by patients. These results are converted into precise analytics and displayed in dashboards so front-line managers can quickly identify problems and make rapid improvements in patient experiences.  Previously the company demonstrated the technical feasibility of its software by focusing on a narrow set of providers.  This research will refine the software so that it is capable of analyzing patient feedback across a wide range of health care organizations. What operational changes will have the greatest, positive impact on patient loyalty and market share?  Results from this project will answer that question for a broad range of health care organizations.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be an instrument that alleviates several
    current difficulties in the growth measurement of many microbes, especially anaerobic
    and other fastidious organisms. A large number of these species are naturally
    occurring in the human body, and have recently been shown to play critical roles
    in allergies, autoimmune diseases, dietary health, cancer, infection response,
    and more. The study of these species is considered by many to be the next frontier
    of modern medicine, especially as current approaches to managing infectious diseases,
    such as traditional antibiotics, appear to be losing effectiveness. However, current
    measurement technology is largely incompatible with the specialized environments
    and chambers in which anaerobic organisms must be grown. There is a large unmet
    need for better ways to measure anaerobic bacterial growth; this need is growing
    quickly as interest in the field increases. The ability to conduct high-throughput
    experiments in specialized environments will become critical as research into
    various human microbiomes accelerates, and demand for high-volume data grows.
    The existing market for high-throughput measurement devices is at least $300 million
    and growing.  This platform will allow for systematic studies of cell culture
    growth that can be accomplished easily and economically. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II
    project proposes to develop and refine a miniaturized multi-well plate reader
    that measures optical characteristics of up to 96 cell samples for measuring growth
    of many microbial samples simultaneously. The continuing rise of systems and computational
    biology demonstrates a growing demand for large amounts of quantitative data,
    and the variety of microbes relevant to the human body necessitates such an approach.
    However, these measurement techniques are not universally accessible due to current
    instruments' complexity, size, and cost. This project will continue development
    of a miniature, simplified version of a device called a multi-well plate reader,
    expanding the availability of parallel growth measurement (and other metrics)
    to a wider array of researchers and environments. The first goal is to simplify
    the instrument's electronics, add an on-board display for clarity, and allow battery-powered
    operation. The next goal is to accelerate equilibration to any surrounding environment
    to allow proper functioning even in extreme conditions, by measuring a wide array
    of environmental variables at different points in space and time. The third goal
    is to solidify the device's mechanical aspects for reliability and stability in
    a shaker. Finally, this project will support the development of a fully-functional
    wireless interface for control and data management, allowing effective remote
    use in any environment.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
    been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome and is characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system?s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden annually, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. Sepsis is highly time critical and every 1-hour delay in antibiotics is associated with a 3-7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Such a tool would ideally gather any relevant information very quickly and provide a probability of sepsis directly back to the physician in less than 30 minutes. If this tool were available, a lot of the uncertainty revolving around early sepsis screening could be minimized. Outcomes such as mortality, readmission rate, length of stay, length of ICU stay, hospital cost, and compliance to Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Core Measures could all be improved by such a tool.

    The goal of the SBIR Phase I project was to establish the feasibility of a point of care sensor that can measure cells and proteins from a drop of blood for the eventual stratification of sepsis. In Phase II, work will continue with our manufacturing partners to design, optimize, and test a one-time-use cartridge and a portable reader for the simultaneous measurement of cells and proteins from a small volume of blood. The objective will be to develop a scalable technology platform, that can measure total white blood cell count, CD64 expression on neutrophils, and 2 proteins (IL-6, and PCT), simultaneously from the same drop of blood, and also be able to measure different proteins by changing the types of beads used in the assay. The goal is to allow physicians and healthcare providers to perform frequent measurements at the point of care, and to integrate the clinical and biological data to predict sepsis and organ dysfunction. The result of this project will be a fully functional reader and accompanying disposable cartridges for the measurement of these critical sepsis biomarkers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from group chat technology that enables knowledge workers to collaborate more effectively than ever before. It is the first tool built that empowers users to efficiently carry out both real-time and asynchronous conversations in the same system, with each user reading only those conversations that are important to him or her. In particular, the technology empowers teams to make decisions in virtual meetings that take place asynchronously over periods of hours or days. This is in contrast with existing group chat technology, where conversations usually end as soon as someone starts talking about something else. This ability to conduct long running, virtual meetings is invaluable for large teams that need to coordinate work across different locations and time zones. Large, distributed teams are fast becoming the norm for how organizations operate, as instant communication and globalization make such teams the workforce of the future. Coordinating the efforts of such teams is a huge pain point for companies, and this technology is a leap in the state of the art in this space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has three major research objectives: scaling the technology to teams of 10,000+ people; faithfully translating the user experience to mobile devices; and developing techniques for serving the needs of diverse deployments large and small. For scalability, one major area is "presence", telling each user who else is currently online. Presence data naturally grows with the number of pairs of users, therefore much faster than the number of users, and the company will need to develop algorithms to focus presence on significant connections between users. Among the unique challenges on mobile, the often-limited Internet connectivity demands algorithms that remember data previously fetched from the server to avoid asking for it again, carefully balanced with getting needed updates to never show out-of-date information to the user; the immediacy required for a great chat experience makes both horns of this dilemma especially sharp. Serving diverse deployments demands techniques for making software updates routine and seamless, a practice recently popularized in browsers and mobile apps but rarely accomplished to date in distributing server applications such as that described here.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on advancing the domestic manufacturing capabilities for high-value nanomaterials for new membrane materials. Previously, the company has developed a novel membrane material with considerable economic, environmental, and nutritional impact in industrial process applications. Commercially available nanofiltration (NF) membrane systems employ polymer membranes, which have inherent chemical and thermal intolerance and are therefore difficult to clean or cannot be used in all separation streams. Meanwhile, 12% of US energy consumption is dedicated to thermal separations, a number that can be cut by a factor of 10 with appropriate physical separation technologies. This technology has applications across food & beverage processing, pharmaceutical production, semiconductor manufacturing, and chemical/petrochemical refining.

    Creating nanometer-scale features on large areas (tens of square meters) will enable technical opportunities for a multitude of products and applications. In this SBIR Phase II project, the company is conducting process development, pilot demonstration, and scale up efforts toward coating graphene oxide thin films for nanofiltration membrane separations applications. Today?s membrane processes are limited by the selectivity and durability of the nanofiltration membrane. Improved selectivity and operational conditions from the material platform enables improved downstream processes, and new product development. The technology is tolerant to elevated temperatures, extreme pH, organic and chlorinated solvents, and high levels of oxidizers. Transitioning from thermal separations to membrane separations saves 90% of the required energy. Meanwhile, payback time is < 3 months when improving clean-in-place (CIP) protocol for existing NF processes. This is a game changer for the separations industry. Key separations of interest include desalting, whey concentration, sugar fractionation, fatty acid separation, nutraceutical extraction, pharmaceutical purification and black liquor concentration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in a significant improvement in the performance, power, and cost of deploying machine learning (ML) solutions through horizontal platform technologies that enable many vertical applications. This improvement will accelerate deployment of intelligent systems and improve scalability through localized intelligence. Our technology automates hardware design, implementation, and deployment to Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platforms. Our initial target verticals: Security and Surveillance, Predictive Maintenance, and Healthcare represent hundreds of billions USD in growth markets for IoT devices and substantially more economic impact through improved efficiency in deployment and operations and reduced societal costs. Improved performance, power consumption and scalability of these key technologies will lead to improved public safety, improved intelligence in home healthcare services, and more efficient manufacturing and energy systems through deployment of Predictive Maintenance technologies on key industrial equipment. Wide deployment of these technologies will lead to substantial energy savings and a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions, reduced economic loss due to negative events, improved scalability and response time to predicted or active negative events, and lower cost in deployment and operations due to low cost, low power, and physically small sensor systems.

    The proposed project focuses on design of high performance, energy-efficient platforms for ML applications, and associated design tools and libraries. Neural networks are heavily used for many machine learning problems but optimizing for efficient deployment currently requires extensive trial-and-error for the large design space of options. Our deep neural network (DNN) optimization framework applies bit-width optimizations, weight sharing and pruning automatically to reduce computation and weight storage demands by more than 10X, while analyzing quality of results impact and using fine-tuned retraining to minimize or eliminate accuracy degradation. Our high level synthesis (HLS) tool then translates optimized networks to hardware while applying pipelining, functional unit parallelism, resource sharing, and platform-specific optimizations. Together these tools automate and accelerate the process of analyzing, optimizing and implementing ML for hardware deployment, reducing time and required expertise for hardware design. Our deployment platforms are modular, composable platforms for small, low-cost deployments of audio/video signal processing, feature extraction and classification, systems control (e.g. pan-tilt-zoom cameras), and communications to decision-making or cloud services. We will extend competitive advantages from our Phase I project with features for solutions in the security/surveillance, predictive maintenance, and healthcare verticals, and tight integration of platforms, tools and IP libraries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enhance precision medicine by reducing data processing time and cost, leading to faster results, higher genomic data processing throughput and, ultimately leading to better treatment of patients. Many diseases have their impacts locked in DNA data. Unlocking the data for an individual may provide a significant boost to human healthcare. By providing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data analysis in one hour, as compared to the current standard of several days, and at a fraction of today's cost, DNA tests can become mainstream and research can be accelerated. WGS data is becoming a key component in ensuring correct and timely treatment of vulnerable populations, including newborn babies, people with cancer and rare diseases, and pregnant women. Correct prediction and treatment based on WGS data will extend human lives and promote better quality of life by accelerating the development and broad implementation of precision medicine.

    The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to develop a cloud-based framework to accelerate whole genome sequencing data analysis.  This SBIR Phase II project creates a software framework where multiple industry-standard genomic analyses will be accelerated transparently to run orders of magnitude faster, while reducing computational costs by up to 4x. The proposed innovation solves the scaling, performance, and cost challenges of WGS computing through novel parallelism extraction and mapping techniques. The framework under development for accelerating genomic analysis has been implemented to focus on GPUs and traditional processors (CPUs). Using this framework, secondary data analysis programs can use all the computing resources present in a standard computing node (CPU cores; GPUs), leading to higher utilization of the system and higher throughput. The GPU accelerates the data parallel portion of the software, while the CPU is mainly responsible for the orchestration of data between CPUs and GPUs, load balancing across multiple accelerators. By providing this framework to run on the cloud and on-premise, users can scale to meet the exploding demands of the DNA analysis industry. The software generates exact results to industry standard tools and does not sacrifice configurability that is critical for users. This framework also will enable researchers and medical professionals to analyze several thousands of genomes simultaneously, leading to higher quality results.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to create an economical, light&#8208;weight,
    high performance Terahertz (THz) spectrometer to allow testing of air and fossil
    fuels for the presence of harmful compounds. A frequency domain THz spectrometer
    is capable of characterizing the different molecules and chemicals in a gas sample.
    Historically these spectrometers have been relegated to the laboratory because
    of their size and complexity but recent technical advancements have made it possible
    to build a spectroscopic THz sensor small enough and light enough to be flown
    on a consumer drone. The reductions in size and cost have opened the door to using
    THz sensors for emissions testing of ships entering U.S. waters or contaminant
    testing of fossil fuels at petroleum processing facilities. This is significant
    because the ability to analyze samples locally removes the time and expense of
    collecting and shipping potentially dangerous compounds (i.e. flammable compounds
    or pollutants) to a laboratory for analysis. It also allows detection and classification
    to occur on short notice and without the need to subject personnel to the local
    environment. \n\nThe proposed project will produce the first article of a compact,
    battery operated, autonomously operating spectroscopic THz sensor capable of mixed
    gas analysis to parts per million sensitivities. It will be constructed predominantly
    from economical off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf fiber optic components in a novel highly

    the spectroscopic THz sensor will incorporate: high fidelity lasers from the telecommunications
    industry, custom designed and fabricated high efficiency, hermetically sealed
    photomixers, a folded, light&#8208;weight, carbon fiber sample cell incorporating
    patented 3D printed mirror technology and a patented optical phase&#8208;modulation
    technique that removes the effects of coherent detection. The instrument will
    first be employed for laboratory based measurements of sulfur-containing contaminants
    in gas flows. Upon the successful demonstration of the capabilities of the instrument,
    a first article will be used in initial testing and collaborative field work.
    Sales of a larger laboratory instrument based on the same technology will begin
    simultaneously.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    This STTR Phase II project will focus on the development of cost effective, high temperature molten salt heat transfer fluids for third generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants with operating temperatures >700?C. In the Phase I of this research, an additive package was developed that formed an adherent ceramic oxide coating on 316/316L stainless steel at the temperatures >700?C when added to specific chloride salt blends and inhibit corrosion. The utilization of the inhibitor package strategy will enable the utilization of economical stainless-steel alloys in the CSP plants and would reduce the infra-structure cost. Such solutions will have a direct impact on the renewable energy market which would help to lower the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for thermal solar from the current cost of 12?/kwh to the target 3?/kwh by 2030. The scientific and technological insight gained in this project could be beneficial to many other applications, such as molten carbonate fuel cells, thermal energy storage systems, nuclear molten fluoride/chloride reactors, and other high-temperature systems that are susceptible to aggressive corrosion. Incorporation of the inhibited molten chloride salt in the CSP plants will also provide sustainable green energy, reduce water usage, create more jobs and offer U.S. energy independence and security. On a societal level, impact will be achieved by the continued delivery and development of educational activities based on the research topics embodied by this work.


    The core innovation in this proposed program is the development of a chemical mixture, an additive package that would minimize the corrosion of stainless steel induced by molten chloride salts at temperatures >700?C. The additive package reacts with the stainless steel and forms a corrosion inhibiting ceramic oxide coating in-situ when added to the molten chlorides at operating temperatures>700?C. The chloride salts are proposed to be the heat transfer fluids for third generation CSP plants. The feasibility of the inhibitor package strategy in a real world CSP plant will be critically assessed in this proposed research. A prototype bench scale molten test loop will be designed and built to mimic the flow conditions in a CSP plant. The effect of prolonged exposure to high temperature molten salts on the mechanical properties of the base metal under dynamic conditions will be studied with attention to the molten salt induced degradation of strength and toughness at elevated temperatures. The degradation behavior of the salt with the inhibitor package will be studied as well. Additional research will be performed to gain fundamental insight on the nucleation and growth of the ceramic oxide coating and its thermal and mechanical stability in dynamic flow conditions.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform intravenous (IV) infusions of biologic medicines into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. Biologics have improved the treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, their delivery is burdensome. The standard of administration of these biologics is often by IV infusion at low concentrations, which can take multiple hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) would necessitate concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's microparticle suspension technology can deliver high concentrations while fully preserving the protein structure, function, and efficacy. Transforming the delivery of biologics offers advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies. Patients will experience less pain and discomfort, save time, have fewer infections, and have better access to biologics. Healthcare providers will be able to process more patients, decrease the chance of complications, and use fewer human resources. Payers will have decreased reimbursement costs. Biopharmaceutical companies will have patented product differentiation and the ability to develop otherwise intractable biologics.

This project's gently processed microparticle suspensions can deliver high concentrations while preserving protein structure and bioactivity, an accomplishment not well-demonstrated with other microparticle technologies. This project aims to advance the readiness level of the innovation by performing process calibration of a bench-scale system, followed by developing and characterizing the resulting particles and suspensions produced on that system. With well-formulated suspensions, in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies will commence. The project will support the development of manufacturing capabilities towards a goal of transitioning to pilot-scale production. This project aims to offer advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning Assistant technology for automatic educational assessments using open response questions. Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students' learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale.

    This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a solution to the problem of drinking water contamination by developing an advanced adsorbent for point-of-use/home filtration applications. Micropollutants, pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, industrial chemicals and other organic compounds present in water resources at trace concentrations of one part per billion and less, are recognized as a major factor of contamination. Consumers around the world no longer trust the safety of their drinking water due to the presence of micropollutants and other contaminants. These compounds are pervasive and can present toxicity at trace concentrations. As a result, consumers have significantly increased the non-sustainable use of plastic bottled water, now a $260 billion market. Current point-of-use filtration products are primarily designed to improve taste and odor, and are generally ineffective in removing micropollutants. CycloPure's technology has been developed specifically to target and remove micropollutants from water. This project focuses on the further development of the company's cyclodextrin adsorbent to improve the effectiveness of point-of-use filters. This material can be used as a drop-in replacement without changes in filter design. CycloPure's materials will allow households to safely use readily available tap water.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to identify strategies to develop a suitable form factor to incorporate CycloPure's high-affinity cyclodextrin adsorbent into point-of-use filters. The company's adsorbent is formed by reacting cyclodextrins, which are derived from corn starch, with readily available monomers in a single step process. During the Phase I period of this project, scalable reaction conditions were identified for production of the adsorbent in powder form. Flow-through applications, such as gravity filters, frequently require granular particles to achieve desired flow rates. Early activities will focus on the preparation of the adsorbent in granular form to demonstrate scalability and retention of removal performance similar to powder form. Thereafter, column studies will be performed in order to assess the removal performance of granular media under flow-through conditions at environmentally relevant micropollutant concentrations. Following identification of adsorption characteristics and appropriate flow conditions, a prototype point-of-use filter will be constructed and tested for the removal of micropollutants from tap water using advanced analytical techniques, including a combination of target and non-target screening approaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of cutting-edge nanopore technology that will greatly enhance biological preservation of regenerative medicines such as stem cells, complex tissues, and organs. Such a technology has the potential to greatly improve the biobanking and transport infrastructure of healthcare for on-demand cells and tissues, improved mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines while maintaining high cell viability and function after cryopreservation, severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport long distances. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S.



    The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. Phase I established a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent (CPA) optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation and dramatically increase post-thaw cell yield, viability, and function. The pore-formers assist CPA loading at reduced temperatures to make up the functional loss of biological protein channels at cold temperatures, reduce the amount of CPA required to remarkably low concentrations, and expand the selectable range of CPAs, all while dynamically dissociating at physiological temperature to prevent open-pore toxicity. Further R&D effort will diversify molecular design, optimize lead molecules, scale-up production, and perform cryopreservation studies on regenerative medicines of major therapeutic significance such as stem cells and complex tissues.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to engineer loblolly pine to increase wood density (yield) by 20% with no additional land, water, or fertilizer use requirements.  With global demand for wood products expected to rise 60% by 2060, managed pine plantations will play a key role in helping to meet this need. By identifying and studying the genes that control plant development, particularly as they relate to cellulose (wood) production in the cell wall, the tree's natural ability to capture and utilize carbon dioxide (CO2) for more wood growth has been enhanced through genetic engineering. This technology will strengthen the United States' position as the leading producer and exporter of commercial wood products, i.e., pulpwood for paper, sawtimber for lumber, and wood pellets for fuel. Additionally, with advancements in the understanding of the pine genome, the work proposed here will stimulate the development of novel innovations in the field of forest genetics while the proposed genetically engineered seedlings help to address growing industry needs for commercial wood products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a more efficient approach to engineering high wood density loblolly pine varieties. In contrast to traditional breeding, which has seen a modest 6% increase in wood density improvements over the past 20 years, this work proposes to increase wood density in pine by 20% through application of a directed, "gene trait" method to genetically engineer loblolly pine by altering secondary cell wall gene regulation. The proposed research will utilize a newly improved pine transformation protocol to scale up prototype production of tree seedlings designed with patent-pending, cell wall gene platform technologies. Also, this work establishes a pine engineering pipeline using germplasm adapted to different selective environments. This will streamline the production process while allowing for faster testing and development of technologies that improve growth traits in multiple growing regions. Specifically, plants engineered with this method will be tested for their long-term wood quality characteristics in both greenhouse and field trials. The goal of this project is to establish a commercial scale production program for loblolly pine engineered seedlings, and prepare for field testing and ultimately commercial sales of the cell wall platform technologies that have been developed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be substantial: a successful project would transform the construction industry, making it far more efficient by reducing legal conflicts, schedule slips and poor decision making. The proposed work will enable the fast and easy creation of 100% complete visual documentation of a physical space; this documentation can be generated many times throughout the course of construction. In so doing, the proposed project will allow professionals in the construction industry to track progress and communicate with their teams far more efficiently than ever before. A second outcome of the project will be the creation of vast, detailed, never before seen datasets of construction projects and real estate, allowing technical innovations in artificial intelligence and computer vision to impact one of the largest industries in the nation and the world. For example, systems could be trained to automatically spot safety concerns, augmenting the efforts of safety managers and keeping workers safer than ever before.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a fast, easy to use and cheap method to create photorealistic immersive models using off the shelf consumer hardware. Technical hurdles include validating the quality and efficacy of models generated with consumer hardware and automatic creation of routes through the 3D space without human annotation. Technical milestones involve using various sensor streams as well as other prior data to build these routes. With these hurdles cleared, advanced work may include automated analytics between and among 3D models of the same site captured over time. Because of the system's ease of use, it will enable the collection of large, totally novel datasets. The goal of the research is to produce a prototype that a layperson can use to create an immersive model of a physical site in order to document it with no annotation effort. The plan to reach these goals includes iterative software development against the hurdles listed above, as well as continuous user feedback to guide and refine development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an instrument platform that will facilitate development and translation of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics that are based on a class of nanovesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, which are nanoparticles shed by cells, are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without the need of invasive tissue biopsies. The lack of tools and techniques to perform high-throughput characterization of EVs is limiting translation. The platform under development will enable an understanding EVs produced by cells. The global market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation in the life sciences is estimated at $5.9 Billion. The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way.

    This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization.  The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques. The completion of these objectives will result in a life science research tool for researchers and industry working on EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a fluidic platform for selective bacterial and endotoxin removal from blood. This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance the use of engineered cell-based therapeutics in the human gut through the development of technologies for the reliable and reversible colonization of the gut with therapeutic bacterial strains. Engineered cellular therapeutics are poised to become the next major driver of pharmaceutical innovation due to their potential for sophisticated behavior and modular design. The gut is an ideal entry point for deploying engineered therapeutic cells, as it serves as our body's natural interface with foreign genetic material. A key impediment to bacterial drug development for the gut is the lack of strategies for achieving predictable colonization across the wide range of gut environments that patients can harbor. Furthermore, tools for on-demand clearance of therapeutic strains to ensure safety do not currently exist. The proposed innovation will overcome these challenges and allow the potential of engineered bacterial cells as therapies to be fully realized.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop the technologies necessary to achieve predictable colonization of, and targeted clearance from, the human gut by engineered bacterial strains. Predictable colonization will be achieved through the use of a therapeutic strain that has been modified to consume a privileged prebiotic substrate that can be dosed alongside the strain to precisely control its abundance by giving it a competitive advantage. To ensure containment and enable targeted clearance, the therapeutic strain will be further modified such that it only can grow in environments where the prebiotic is present. This will allow for the generation of a robust synthetic niche within the gut that can be manipulated solely through the administration of this prebiotic control molecule. In addition, to enable the commercial deployment of these novel technologies, manufacturing protocols will be developed to ensure that a fully integrated therapeutic strain can be produced in sufficient quantities and stably formulated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop engineered brewer's yeast to produce hop flavor compounds during beer fermentation, so as to replace the need for agriculturally produced hops.  Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer's yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer's yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer's yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer's yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer's yeast.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in its potential to develop a new mechanism for painlessly terminating atrial fibrillation.  Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the leading causes of death and debilitation.  A common means of terminating harmful rhythms is delivering a shock via an external or implantable defibrillator.  The pain from the shock is the number one concern for patients with implantable defibrillators, and because of the pain, an implantable option is not practical for atrial fibrillation.  The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the field of defibrillation therapy and aims to lead to the introduction of a new class of implantable medical device technology.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and evaluate an implantable device that achieves non-destructive temporary conduction delay in cardiac tissues for the painless termination, and potentially prevention, of life threatening arrhythmias.  Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. More than 1,000 Americans die each day from sudden cardiac arrest.  The team intends to initially target the development of a device to achieve rapid and painless termination of life threatening arrhythmias to treat atrial fibrillation. The successful development of the proposed device has the potential to benefit millions of patients.  Additionally, by virtue of its painless modulation of arrhythmogenesis, the proposed device may well also terminate incipient arrhythmias.  The phase II project will develop and evaluate a prototype system.  It is anticipated that the project will result in a new implantable medical device that painlessly terminates atrial fibrillation.

    The proposed project centers around further development on the world's smallest 2-way communications satellites and associated ground hardware. Key contributions of this project include system and networking optimization and validation of the technology through end to end demonstrations. The system optimization component will involve the development of system-level models that capture the complex interaction of all elements, including dynamics, constraints, and objectives. The network optimization component will focus on the development of algorithms that enable seamless communications scheduling as the network scales to several thousand devices on the ground.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project spans commercial, scientific and humanitarian applications by extending IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity to remote regions without cell coverage and where satellite data is prohibitively expensive for vital applications including agriculture, energy, shipping, and weather. The satellites and ground hardware being developed in this SBIR Phase II project have been driven towards miniaturization and power reduction to enable a broader range of customers to take advantage of the network by allowing easy integration into their devices and easy-to-install autonomous ground solutions.  The unique launch economics afforded by the miniaturized satellites enable IoT (Internet of Things) sensing and data return at a cost 1/10th to 1/100th that of incumbent satellite data providers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to extend the function of windows by turning them into daytime sources of electricity. The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window's glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn't been commercialized previously because most tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project will provide a novel solution to these problems with a low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on scaling up prototypes and optimization for cost and reliability. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned fossil fuels needed to generate electricity. 

    The proposed project develops and scales up the electricity-generating window prototypes to the square meter size, validates long-term reliability, optimizes for manufacturing, and launches pilot projects. The technology is based on luminescent solar concentrators, which are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots are more stable, but are expensive, sometimes toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimal for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. At the conclusion of the phase II project, prototype products will be installed in at least one building.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to develop a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other materials into large numbers cells at the same time. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. The proposed technology provides a safe, turnkey, and scalable technology with a potential transformative impact in research and life sciences laboratories and companies, representing a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the proposed nanostraw design, transfection protocol, and cell preparation improves immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve >50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells. Market analysis has found this level of transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The transfection protocol will be optimized and codified into a simple to follow set of instructions. A turn-key instrument will be developed to carry out these procedures for use by life science researchers, with reduced device costs through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods. The market-ready product will be evaluated by eight preclinical immune cell research beta sites to discover new treatment pathways.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is developing a safe and sustainable ink for
    the global ink industry. Approximately nine billion pounds of ink is produced
    annually around the world.  Currently, ink is predominantly made of petroleum
    or inorganic chemicals mined from the earth. For example, carbon black is commonly
    used in traditional ink, which is derived from petroleum, not biodegradable, and
    toxic for humans. To solve this problem, nature has produced a multitude of molecules
    capable of replacing pigments currently utilized in ink. While many organisms
    that produce these alternatives are slow growing and require energy sources like
    sugar, photosynthetic microbes, such as cyanobacteria, are capable of being engineered
    in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe,
    renewable, and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing
    packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating
    these ink products will decrease significantly the overall detrimental impact
    of traditional inks on the environment, and more importantly, human health. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop sustainable ink formulations using cyanobacteria
    as feedstock for producing optically black pigments for printing inks. This project
    will also engineer cyanobacteria cells capable of generating cellular pigments
    for a color spectrum of cyan, magenta, and yellow. These colored cyanobacteria
    will act as pigments that replace mined pigments found in traditional ink formulations,
    such as carbon black and cadmium. This project is developing a unique process
    in which extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary, thus saving energy and
    reducing cost.   Using cyanobacteria cells as pigments creates a renewable source
    of biomass for bio-products, as these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide,
    wastewater and land otherwise unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly
    generate biomass. In addition to the development of colorful renewable cyanobacteria
    strains, this project will focus on manufacturing thousands of pounds of ink products
    for testing and consumer use as well as testing the applicability of these natural
    pigments to act as colorants in the food and textile industries.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the potential to help enhance disease resistance in poultry and increase yields due to the delivery of only healthy, fully vaccinated chicks to farms. These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, aiding to combat antimicrobial resistance.  This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries, and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given. Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas for delivery of substances to live animals or humans.


    This SBIR Phase II project will allow for the advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies for the use of screening and targeting live animals. This proposal brings innovation in the care of food animals allowing for producers to move away from flock health and focus on the care of individual animals. This will be a dramatic change for the poultry industry, but is necessary in the face of antibiotic removal to be able to improve the current vaccination efficiencies and screen chicks for health status. Individualized care is currently not possible due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large scale commercial hatchery operation. The technical challenges this proposal will overcome include 1) the safe and effective handling of chicks in an automated system that can process 100,000 chicks per hour, 2) the development of imaging systems for health checks and target recognition, 3) the delivery of the appropriate dose of vaccine with the correct amount of agents (virus, bacteria, parasite, and other agents) while not damaging the agents during delivery, and 4) development of a system that is rugged and robust enough to survive in a hatchery environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from greatly improving mobile app user experience, boosting developer productivity, and speeding up mobile innovations by automating the mundane and simplifying the complex in Android app testing.  Apps are now everywhere.  They innovate almost every industry.  By making it easy to build high-quality apps, users enjoy better experience and developers enjoy better productivity, benefiting every industry and person that use apps.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to modernize the software development process by combining both program analysis research breakthroughs and big data technologies. Toward this vision, this project aims to build a unique product with innovative technologies to help developers automatically test Android apps. The product continuously tests apps across code changes to detect issues such as performance regressions, crashes, and memory leaks, as soon as problematic code is introduced. In contrast, existing tools often alert developers too late, after real users have been affected and many code changes have been merged, making it both stressful and difficult to find the problematic code. The proposed product gives actionable diagnosis by pinpointing what problematic code developers need to fix and explaining the why and how of the fix. It is thus much more intelligent and easy to use than existing tools.

    if successful in mitigating the high technical risks, represents a huge leap in the state of the
    art in 3D hand models for gesture recognition and has the potential to be the industry
    standard for AR, VR, Robotics and IoT applications with broad societal impact in education,
    medical and healthcare. Its broader impact is further amplified by the potential in serving the
    needs of the disabled community in improving their quality of life by being better able to
    communicate, learn and adapt to their interaction needs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to significantly
    advance current 3D hand gesture recognition technology by developing a dynamic hand
    tracking model for gesture intent recognition. It is robust against occlusion and tolerant to
    variations in camera orientation and position. This research will result in a transformative
    leap above the current state of academic and commercial hand models and overcome key
    technical hurdles that have so far proven difficult to overcome. It solves the following key
    challenges and involves very high technical risks: 1) robust hand tracking while holding
    objects and 2) robust tangible interactions using objects without using any fiducial markers
    2) low profile hand wearable for touch interaction detection. This Phase 2 project will
    achieve these objectives by 1) data acquisition and hand-object pose estimation, 2)
    understanding user intents with enhanced tangible interactions, and 3) system validation
    and user testing.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be to demonstrate the potential

    The field of metabolic engineering historically has been limited in predicting
    the behavior of complex biological systems in vivo from simplified models and
    basic in vitro biochemical principles. In many cases, it has proven much more
    difficult than expected to integrate a well characterized production pathway into
    a living host and balance the complex requirements of both biomass growth and
    production. The technology under development is a first of its kind, truly scalable,
    high-throughput metabolic engineering platform enabling the rapid development
    of microbial production strains. This significant reduction in development cost
    enables the possibility to produce numerous specialty products that would otherwise
    not have acceptable internal return on development capital. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    II project will develop a high throughput metabolic engineering platform that
    enables the rapid development of microbial production strains. The platform, which
    bridges a gap between current in vivo and in vitro bio-production approaches,
    relies on the dynamic minimization of the active metabolic network in the context
    of a standardized two-stage bioprocess. Metabolic networks are highly interconnected
    wherein each metabolite and/or enzyme can interact with endless others. This combinatorial
    complexity results in a huge potential design space, which is intractable to the
    kinds of systematic experimentation required for the development of standardized
    design principles. The global challenges in addressing such a large biological
    design space have persisted, despite the dramatic advances in, and decreased costs
    of, reading and writing DNA, high-throughput DNA assembly, and microbial strain
    construction approaches. Dynamic metabolic network minimization not only results
    in a design space with greatly reduced complexity, but also provides strains that
    are robust to environmental conditions. Robustness leads to predictable scalability
    from high-throughput small-scale screens or \"microfermentations\" to fully instrumented
    bioreactors. This project will extend the validation of predictable strain performance
    from high-throughput microfermentation to pilot scale fermentation."

    that enable facilities managers to assess as-is conditions of assets, avoid non
    value-add activities and plan maintenance tasks to avoid failures and shutdown.
    This will contribute towards transforming a traditional industry to an advanced
    data-driven one.  It will also enable significant reduction in the disruptions
    caused to occupants due to failures in facilities.  Given that Americans spend
    85-90% of their time indoors and any disruptions caused by facilities directly
    impact their qualities of lives, the broader societal impact of reducing failures
    in facilities is significant.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase II project intends to research, develop and demonstrate the feasibility
    of using big data analytics and machine learning to transform facilities operations
    and maintenance decisions. Owners and operators of the over five million commercial
    and institutional buildings in the United States are faced with the challenges
    of managing aging and crowded building infrastructure. They waste between 30%
    and 40% of resources by operating in a predominantly inefficient, reactive mode.
    This project targets development of computational mechanisms that automatically
    analyze integrated building information to identify patterns that lead to actionable
    insights that help reduce non value-add activities and improve resource utilization
    in FM daily operation and planning. By combining advanced machine learning technologies
    with existing building information modeling (BIM) resources, the company is proposing
    to develop high-impact, statistical and visual methods for optimizing the decision-making
    abilities of facility managers and with that, the performance of critical facilities
    infrastructure and maintenance crews.  The results of this research will include
    algorithms and methods to normalize heterogeneous building data, detect patterns
    and anomalies, from which actionable insights can be derived with domain knowledge,
    and generate qualitative and quantitative output appropriate for improved decision
    making in managing commercial facilities."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new technology that combines advanced bioengineering with traditional chemical manufacturing. This hybrid approach will allow production of high value chemicals for the polymer industry using biomass at a lower price than current petrochemical based processes. This unique approach allows for the retrofit of existing ethanol fermentation facilities in rural areas with a bolt-on chemical upgrading unit to produce chemicals with far higher value than ethanol, improving the economics of operating these facilities and creating new jobs. The initial chemical product targeted by this project has an estimated $100M annual market and is used in manufacturing a variety of consumer products including specialty polyurethanes, inks, and UV degradable plastics which can be dramatically expanded to $1B by 2020 through cost reductions enabled by this new technology. Eventually, this approach combining existing fermentation facilities with a bolt-on chemical processing unit can be used to produce carbon-neutral fuels that are fully compatible with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel at price comparable to current petrochemical fuels. This project, while here focused on the higher value polymer market, will enable later development of cost competitive fuel production technology.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate at pilot scale a complete downstream process capable of manufacturing the target chemical from the intermediate platform molecule produced with fermentation. In upstream Visolis work, the key intermediate has been produced using fermentation facilities hosted at the Advanced Biofuels Process Demonstration Unit at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories and the National Renewable Research Laboratories (NREL) at pilot scale, and based on current performance metrics the intermediate can be manufactured at prices comparable to ethanol at commercial scale. The goals of this downstream project are to utilize the intermediate generated using a 9000L scale fermentation facility at NREL to demonstrate cost-effective production of the target product from this intermediate. The work includes construction of a pilot scale high pressure chemical reactor, production and testing of several catalysts for performance in producing the target molecule at different process conditions, optimization of the chemical production process, evaluation of the process and catalyst for long-term stability, purification of the products to the levels required by customers, and technoeconomic modeling to inform the design of a commercial facility.

    Innovation Research Phase II project is to offer a low-cost novel filter to purify
    water with higher effectiveness and superior performance than currently available
    technologies such as carbon filters. The global water scarcity, including some
    parts of the US such as the southwest, has led to a strong need for efficient
    technologies to purify wastewater for direct or indirect potable reuse. Recently,
    there has been growing concerns over emerging contaminants such as perfluorinated
    compounds (PFCs e.g. PFOA and PFOS) in surface and groundwater. These PFCs are
    being found at many groundwater sites and in drinking water wells affected by
    PFCs. Current technologies are not efficient for the removal of PFCs from water,
    and there is an immediate need for new cost-effective treatment technologies.
    To address this unfulfilled need, this project seeks to develop a low cost, reusable
    filter unit for water purification to remove emerging contaminants such as PFCs.
    The technology is expected to be used by entities conducting industrial wastewater
    and groundwater treatment, and wastewater utilities that have a focus on water
    reuse. \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a prototype
    water filter,  test and optimize it for the removal of emerging contaminants with
    a focus on PFCs. Specifically, the project will focus on: (1) optimization of
    the adsorbent performance and synthesis method; and scale-up of the synthesis
    method for bulk production of filter media; (2) optimization of the filter regeneration
    process; and (3) design, construct, and test a prototype unit of the technology;
    and determine the process cost. The work will confirm the effectiveness of the
    filter in removing the target contaminants as well as the effectiveness of the
    regeneration process to reuse the filter. The PFC contaminants will be first removed
    from the water and then destroyed. The overall performance of the technology will
    also be evaluated and compared with other available technologies to determine
    its cost-effectiveness."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to fundamentally change what a storage device can do, and give storage a third capability that is not addressed by existing storage technology - the ability to actually process user data.  For the computation to take place, only the computational request and the resulting data need to transfer over the storage interface, reducing interface traffic and the required power. The advent of Big Data and the increasing use of Hyperscale Server technology have resulted in the creation of an additional storage tier that is different from traditional enterprise storage. This new tier requires significantly larger capacity yet lower cost, lower operating power, and yet must still exhibit enterprise level reliability. This combination of characteristics cannot be serviced by existing technologies, and execution with large data sets typical of Big Data results in inefficient solutions. The information being stored represents the large, unstructured data mined by today's companies for key information and trends that help dictate corporate direction, advertising, and monetization. Future applications include machine learning for video analytics, genome sequencing and enabling Fog Storage and Fog Computing, among others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project explores the Big Data paradigm shift where processing capability is pushed as close to the data as possible. The In-Situ processing technology pushes this concept to the absolute limit, by putting the computational capability directly into the storage itself and eliminating the need to move data to main memory before processing. The technology innovation begins with a solid foundation of an enterprise SSD tailored for the needs of modern Data Centers. Key technology that will be added to support these capabilities include hardware-assisted quality of service control, low-cost 3D-TLC and QLC NAND Flash enablement through the use of advanced ECC, and a proprietary elastic Flash Translation Layer to support extremely large capacity drives. The final element added to this foundation will be the ability to perform computation directly on the data with the addition of specialized In-Situ processing aided by hardware accelerators.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new alloys whose thermal expansion properties can be tailored for laser applications. The tailored thermal expansion alloys will prevent shifts in laser output frequencies, i.e. laser color, by preventing the natural temperature-induced thermal expansion and contraction that occurs in laser housings. This temperature stability is extremely important for fiber-optic systems that are the backbone of the telecommunications industry. According to Strategies Unlimited, the telecommunications laser market was $3.515 billion in 2014, and it is expected to increase with the increasing number of mobile devices and growing demand for high-speed internet. While oil and gas telecommunications systems were identified as the beachhead market, the alloys developed through this project will also have potential to add value to the wider telecommunications market and a number of other industrial and electronics applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a new method to exhibit unprecedented control over thermal expansion properties in metal alloys. The discovery that mechanical deformation tailors or "programs" the thermal expansion of a bulk metal to match that of other common materials (metals, polymers, and ceramics) will change the way scientists and engineers design for thermal compensation. These alloys can also be tailored not to expand or contract with temperature changes and even be made to shrink when heated. This wide range of tailored alloy responses is achieved without chemical changes or composite fabrication methods upon which competing technologies rely. This Phase II project will reduce the risks associated with implementing the tailored thermal expansion alloy technology in laser applications by developing high thermal conductivity alloys and testing prototypes. Alloys will be purchased, engineered to have a desired coefficient of thermal expansion, and tested for laser performance. The expected outcome of this work is the realization of tailored thermal expansion alloys in laser prototypes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide a usable stranded and associated gas collection capacity for oil & gas exploration companies. During drilling operations, valuable gas is lost through intentional venting and flaring, causing losses in natural gas delivered to the power plant or city gate. With the sector's expansion into more remote low-volume sites, these losses are increasing dramatically. Through this project's proposed novel Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) based storage technology, this project seeks to deliver a re-usable and transport ready intermodal container, to store gas at low pressure, eliminating the need to use expensive gas capture, purification and multi-stage compression systems. An economically feasible unprocessed natural gas storage technology would provide a useful tool for the domestic oil & gas industry in capturing what would be flared or vented and delivering it to the American economy. Taking the proposed novel MOF technology to the bench and pilot scale will show the feasibility of a flexible, transportable, low-cost infrastructure to abate flaring and venting. Successful developments in this project will help develop the knowledge for scale-up to large-scale vehicular tanks to allow for commercial implementation.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are the development of stable and low-cost Metal-Organic framework (MOF) based storage technologies for the collection of usable stranded associated gas during drilling operations. In order to harness point source emissions, before being vented or flared, the project will develop a nano-engineered, MOF based sorbent for low-pressure capture and storage of unprocessed natural gas. The project will seek to develop a robust and scalable method to synthesize new MOFs containing other high-valence transition metal ions such as Al3+, Fe3+ and Cr3+. Furthermore, the project will screen a range of organic ligands for improving MOFs' surface property and storage capacity. Finally, by following alternative synthesis routes with low cost catalysts, the project will identify sorbent synthesis cost reduction strategies. The sorbent material will be tested with simulated vent/flare-gas compositions in a cyclic pressure range and the sorbent stability will be verified by an assortment of X-ray, spectroscopy, and microscopy methods. Following sorbent development, an ANG tank will be built and flare gas slipstream testing will be conducted in shale gas sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to transform commercial construction through the democratization of scanning and automation of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Constant design and change management is a unique challenge that is costing the US construction industry billions of dollars annually. In order to prevent such a huge economic loss, this industry is in the path for a digital revolution. BIM is known as the first truly global digital technology that could revolutionize the construction industry. However, BIM usage is currently limited because it is only viable for large-scale projects. The primary reason is that the process is too laborious and expensive. The proposed technology will completely eliminate these barriers. Its ease-of-use, ubiquity of the capturing device, and automated object detection democratizes as-built BIM modeling. Enormous value could be generated due to streamlining and data management capabilities that are offered by the technology in the form of accelerated project schedules, reduced numbers of requests for information and change orders, and timely identified design clashes. This will pave the way to increase the competitiveness of the US construction industry, by enabling new products and services that support automatic BIM modeling.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the technical and commercial feasibility of an automatic and inexpensive solution for the Scan-to-BIM problem in the construction industry. Scan-to-BIM refers to 3D scanning of a physical structure and converting the captured raw spatial data into an object-oriented, semantically-rich model. Although there are a few technologies that aim to facilitate this process, the 3D modeling component remains primarily a manual and time-consuming task. When using the proposed technology, a non-technical worker videotapes the target structure. The video is automatically sent to a server for processing. A unique videogrammetric 3D reconstruction engine reconstructs the 3D geometry of the structure in the form of a 3D point cloud. It then extracts object hypotheses from key video frames and spatial data in the form of observations. Afterwards, it optimizes a novel coherent joint probability distribution function and infers a 3D layout. The outcome is an object-oriented 3D representation of the structure with embedded geometrical attributes and property sets. The main novelty of this technology lies in a hybrid approach that combines low-level segmentation with high-level space modeling. This advances the state-of-the-art in robust intelligence, particularly the interpretation of complex, unstructured data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address one of the primary barriers to the emergence of flexible electronics -the inability to assembly and interconnect thinned integrated circuits (ICs) onto flexible substrates in a reliable, cost-effective, high volume manner. Flexible electronics has been the subject of many industry journals, trade shows, technical conferences and market research reports. All describe a new age of ubiquitous electronics with devices embedded in the structures and items around us.  Flexible electronic devices, unlike today's devices that are rigid and boxy, can conform to natural, curved shapes that exist in the real world. However, flexible electronics have yet to have their predicted economic and social impact. A major reason is because the electronics industry has not yet found a reliable, low-cost method for assembling thin, flexible ICs onto flexible circuit boards. Today's 'pick-and-place' assembly technology cannot handle ICs thin enough to be flexible. Until a new method is developed and adopted, the potential of flexible electronics will likely not be realized.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the integrated circuit (IC) aspects of a flexible hybrid electronics technology to a level at which these devices can be produced reliably and in volumes in a production-relevant environment. While most of the components of flexible hybrid electronics technology relating to printed electronics methods have been adequately researched and developed, little has been done on the integration of solid-state semiconductor devices onto highly flexible, organic substrates. Partial results have been reported in the literature, however, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive, wafer-to-end product approach suitable for commercial applications. This project will address this gap by focusing on all the steps for IC integration, including the preparation for assembly of ultra-thin, flexible semiconductor dies, their attachment onto a flexible circuit board using laser-enabled assembly technology, and their reliable electrical interconnection. The anticipated end results will be a complete flexible hybrid electronics integration technology developed to a level of pilot production readiness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project in the long term has two main components.  First, the development has potential to reduce the country's overall energy consumption by funding the development of low cost air quality sensors for energy efficient buildings.  And second, the project will enhance the safety of our natural gas infrastructure with a low cost, low power methane (natural gas) sensor technology.    This work will develop a methane (natural gas) sensor prototype with 10x lower cost, size and power consumption than current solutions.  The proposed methane sensor will meet several currently unmet needs.  These include enhanced public safety by enabling methane leak detection for natural gas distribution systems, and protecting first responders by enabling more and better methane detection in hazardous environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the world's most porous materials, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a sensing material.  MOFs have been an active topic in material science research for over a decade, but they have yet to find a commercial application.  This project promises to be the first commercialization of this exciting new class of materials.  Nearly 40,000 different MOF structures have been identified to date.  The crux of this work is to use a combination of computer models and laboratory experimentation to optimize a MOF structure that selectively and rapidly absorbs methane gas.  The end goal of this project is to develop a commercial prototype methane sensor 'on a chip' that consists of a solid state mass transducer with the MOF coating that has been tuned for sensing methane.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer electronics market
    (mobile handsets, tablets, game consoles and wearables), wherein high performance, low power, small footprint
    multisensing (not limited to inertial sensing) platforms with timing devices, are all directly microfabricated on a common
    ASIC substrate. Sensor fusion can produce unprecedented user experiences by using data collected from all sensors and
    processed using machine learning algorithms. This can further boost the sensor and timing markets that are expected to
    exceed $6 billion dollars by 2017. Moreover, the emergent Internet of Things (IoTs) and wearable markets are expected to
    reach $20 billion dollars by 2025, which can induce a rapid growth of such intelligent sensor fusion market. This can have
    a tremendous societal impact as wearable devices and IoT systems, interfaced with mobile platforms, can be used to
    monitor people?s health, safety and energy consumption. Making these solutions affordable will make it amenable to low
    income households not only in the US but also around the world. It will also enable researchers to attain new frontiers of
    knowledge such as in digital sensory systems. The long-term goals are to provide such intelligent sensor fusion solutions.

    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to demonstrate wafer-scale microfabrication of
    Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors directly on the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
    substrates, by using electroplated copper (e-Cu) as a structural material. MEMS inertial sensors, such as gyroscopes and
    accelerometers, are pervasively used in consumer electronics and automotive industries. Current trends are, however,
    requiring higher device performance with smaller footprints, wherein multi-degree-of-freedom sensors are integrated on
    the same package, to enable new capabilities and user experiences. These requirements can be met by monolithically
    fabricating inertial sensors on ASIC substrates, which is complex to achieve with silicon as a structural material. Using e-
    Cu, which is currently used for ASIC metal interconnects, as the structural material, can enable easier routing to
    implement optimized mechanical structures, smaller dimensions given the high density of copper, extremely low cost as
    no wafer bonding is required, smaller form factors, multiple sensors on a single die, and much smaller parasitics providing
    low noise and higher performance. Phase II tasks will be to wafer-scale fabricate an inertial measurement unit that is
    monolithically integrated with its ASIC with optimal performance parameters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is significant; transitions of care impact millions of Americans every year. The healthcare system bears substantial cost and inefficiency&#8232;on account of suboptimal care transitions and overspending. This Phase II project will support progress towards a "learning healthcare system" and will extend the capabilities of data mining and machine learning in healthcare

    The proposed project seeks to improve data mining technologies for healthcare decision support. This project will focus on the analysis of a broad variety&#8232;of data types that are common in healthcare settings. The anticipated improvements would allow frontline care staff, operational managers, and healthcare executives to assess and make stronger evidence-driven decisions regarding quality, cost, and access as patients move through the healthcare system. The enhanced data mining system would utilize state-of-the-art pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to dynamically process and interpret clinical, claims, and other types of healthcare data. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics.

    lower the operating temperature in chemical reactions thereby decreasing energy
    usage and giving products with fewer impurities, requiring a smaller number of

    explore the applicability of a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscopy (GD-OCM)
    instrument to image and evaluate optical materials as part of the manufacturing
    process.  The immediate broader impact of this project is to effectively provide
    both qualitative and quantitative information about product quality in manufacturing,
    with an initial focus on contact lens manufacturing. Providing high-speed, industrial,
    micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions, GD-OCM enables contact lens
    manufacturers to replace multiple inspection steps with a single measurement done
    automatically, reducing the opportunity for damaging the samples and human error,
    and ultimately leading to increased productivity and yield.  The resulting improvements
    in contact lens performance and extended wear effects are poised to have a positive
    impact on a significant percentage of the population.  Recent evaluations of GD-OCM
    have indicated its ability to provide a new wealth of characterization methods
    for quality control of various materials that are otherwise impossible to characterize
    nondestructively, including gradient refractive index polymers, glass and layered
    structures.  Additionally, GD-OCM will enable new advances in a wide variety of
    scientific fields via its capability to non-invasively optically section samples
    of a variety of material types. \n\nThe objective of this Phase II project is
    to establish the effectiveness of the emerging GD-OCM technology for nondestructive
    on-line metrology of contact lenses in manufacturing. Quality control and detection
    of product-significant defects, and a corresponding increase in production yield,
    represent the value proposition for the introduction of GD-OCM instrumentation
    into the contact lens production environment. The project will result in two major
    outcomes: 1) implementation of a robust production-environment instrument to effectively
    provide micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions and quantification
    of yield-relevant contact lens quality metrics not previously available in a single
    instrument; and 2) demonstration of the technology for inspection in a production
    environment to rapidly and accurately monitor defects and quantify contact lens
    quality using product relevant metrics. This nondestructive, on-line optical inspection
    system can have significant impact not only on the process control and thereby
    yield of contact lenses, but also in manufacturing of layered materials in general,
    including polymers, plastics, and glass. Longer-term, the technology offers new
    paths for tissue imaging, guided surgery, and monitoring of eye disease."

    were photonic crystal structures consisting of regularly repeating, orderly lattices

    to have photonic bandgaps. This longstanding assumption is now known to be false.
    New photonic bandgap structures, characterized by suppressed density fluctuations
    (hyperuniformity), include disordered structures that are isotropic. This means
    that light propagates the same way through the photonic solid independent of direction
    (which is impossible for a photonic crystal). While the layout of waveguides in
    conventional photonic crystal  and quasi crystal photonic bandgap materials is
    tightly-constrained to follow characteristic crystal axes, the layout rules for
    hyper uniform disordered solid waveguides have no such fundamental constraints.
    The universal protocol and highly-efficient computational framework covering the
    full range of photonic crystal, quasi crystal , and hyper uniform disordered solid-based
    photonic bandgaps will be generalized to a broad class of critically important

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are both technical and economic. The developed error-correction solutions will enable flash-memory-based devices to have higher capacities, higher reliability, and faster speeds at lower power while driving down the cost. This will have a major impact on mobile computing capabilities and enterprise storage by improving the efficiency and reliability of data centers, servers, and mission-critical storage that incorporate flash memories. Improved enterprise storage boosts the efficiency and growth of IT businesses, e-commerce, and financial trade. The solutions will also enable reduced power consumption and heat dissipation leading to greener systems.  The benefits of the error-correction solutions are also applicable to the hard disk drive and communications industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate novel low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based error-correction for flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are rapidly being deployed for both enterprise and consumer storage due to their fast speeds, low power, and low heat dissipation. But they bring numerous technical challenges stemming from the fact that reducing flash memory cell sizes leads to an unavoidable degradation in the reliability. With a trend of increasing die density to enable higher storage capacities, the industry is swiftly moving towards adopting LDPC codes to provide more powerful error-correction. However existing LDPC solutions use complex post-processing and multiple reads to bring down the error rates to the desired levels which lowers the read speeds, making them unattractive for future SSDs.  Novel binary LDPC-based solutions will be developed for a range of parameters, and validated in hardware.  The design method will be extended to develop new non-binary LDPC solutions which provide even greater reliability enhancements, leading to greater endurance in SSDs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aligns with a major shift in healthcare to reduce hospital acquired infections. At a cost of over $1.5B and 600,000 extra hospital days in the US alone, surgical wound infection in high-risk abdominal surgery patients is a major healthcare burden. In addition, providers and hospitals face greater scrutiny of their wound infection rates today, and the sweeping changes of healthcare reform have incentivized these critical stakeholders to invest in preventative solutions. However, currently available solutions are insufficient, and existing surgical device companies have not developed a compelling pipeline of products to address this unmet need. The proposed technology enjoys a competitive advantage in that it operates in a relatively open competitive landscape, and its unique mechanism of action provides a comprehensive wound protection strategy. Thus, this technology has the potential to make a significant worldwide impact on wound infection, both from a healthcare quality and commercialization standpoint. The initial market for this technology is in colorectal surgery, with ample expansion opportunities into other abdominal surgical markets totaling over $1 billion.


    The proposed project seeks to develop and commercialize a novel technology designed to prevent one of the most frequent, morbid, and costly hospital-acquired infections: surgical wound infection. The technology is an innovative surgical tool that provides a comprehensive anti-contamination strategy for the wound that is also user-friendly for the surgeon. This device has the potential to be a transformative innovation in the quality of surgical care, particularly in the 3.5 million patients undergoing high-risk abdominal-gastrointestinal (GI) surgery in whom wound infections are the most common. The technology also allows surgeons to experiment with a variety of approaches to identify ?best practices? for intraoperative wound care. This Phase II project proposes three main objectives. First, the company will refine the scientific understanding of the local and systemic therapeutic of the anti-contamination therapy through numerical modeling and pre-clinical testing in a porcine model in order to provide clinical use recommendations. Second, the company will design and develop a product sized for laparoscopic surgeries in order to support a broad-based commercialization effort. Third, the company with develop scaled manufacturing capability to support commercial release of the CleanCision product platform.

    research objectives are (1) to optimize pump performance and usability (2) to
    extend cage size compatibility and connectivity (3) to optimize software usability
    (4) to optimize system design and establish quality assurance processes for scale-up
    and (5) to conduct an in-vivo validation study.  Successful demonstration of the
    remotely-controlled implantable infusion pump system will enable new dosing schemes,
    provide precise temporally controlled dosing for more reproducible results from
    acute and chronic studies, and enable new approaches to drug therapy that would
    not otherwise be possible. \n\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this
    project lies in uniquely improving scientific outcomes and facilitating the drug
    development/discovery process. Currently, only one in 10,000 drug candidates successfully
    attain FDA approval with a significant number of candidates failing or discarded
    due to inadequate drug administration.  Rapid and accurate evaluation of efficacy,
    safety and toxicity early in the drug development process is improved through
    the fully automated, wirelessly-controlled drug dosing technology supported by
    this Phase II project.  This project targets the international laboratory animal
    market estimated at $3.4B in 2012. Animal models are employed throughout the drug
    development pipeline and in particular, rodents are critical to drug candidate
    target validation, screening, and optimization. Included in this effort are several
    significant first-to-market capabilities such as chronic dosing capability in
    freely-moving, tether-free mice and high-throughput evaluation of multiple new
    drugs through automation. The controlled delivery of agents, including emerging
    biologics, siRNA, peptides, and small molecules, is an important capability in
    a multitude of clinical and preclinical research applications including neuroscience,
    pharmacology, toxicology, and physiology. More importantly, this project will
    enable drug studies that to be performed in a manner that will facilitate and
    enhance the translation of candidate therapies from animal to human."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project is a game-based learning virtual reality
    (VR) and desktop experience focused on fostering STEM (science, technology, engineering,
    and math) and robotics interest in young people. The project's intent is to address
    the growing skilled labor shortage in STEM fields and prepare learners for the
    cross-industrial rise of robotics. Through exposure to experiential STEM learning,
    the project will create a groundswell of student interest and aptitude that will
    help close STEM workforce gaps in the long term, as well as plant the seeds for
    a future cohort of robotics professionals. The project's hypothesis is that its
    game-based VR-enhanced learning platform can reliably instill design/engineering
    thinking skills into learners while exceeding the capabilities of existing educational
    tools in terms of scalability and adaptability to student needs. The project is
    additionally intended to drive K-12 VR hardware adoption by providing a compelling
    and teacher-customizable solution that will justify institutional hardware investments.
    When proven scalable, the project will act as a beachhead for other VR and game-based
    learning entrants to bring their own innovative learning content into the K-12
    ecosystem, simultaneously promoting the progress of science in alignment with
    the NSF's mission, as well as providing a broad economic lift to the American
    economy by unlocking a new market sector. \n\nAs a VR-first experience, this project
    will provide students with a first-of-its-kind immersive robotics sandbox that
    allows for hands-on experimentation. Players will be able to form hypotheses,
    build robots, test, and iterate, mirroring the processes of project-based robotics
    and maker programs. Beyond robot construction, the project will offer challenge
    courses that test players' ability to build to specification. Each course will
    require a different physics-based solution for which a capable robot must be constructed.
    For example, a course might challenge players to navigate a set of stationary
    obstacles and then place a cube on a pressure plate, requiring a robot with maneuverability
    and the ability to pick up, transport, and place objects. This task serves as
    a model of the underlying dynamics of engineering design: identifying a problem,
    thinking critically, and developing a solution engineered specifically to that
    problem. To establish this project in the larger context of teaching media, it
    will be developed as a desktop-only intervention, a VR-only intervention, a desktop/VR
    hybrid intervention, and a paper-based control intervention. These variants will
    be tested with middle school and high school end users to verify the efficacy
    of game-based VR as a pedagogy.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a comprehensive physiological monitoring platform that provides individuals working in hazardous occupations, such as firefighters, with longitudinal and real-time physiological monitoring that includes predictive diagnostics. Because existing physiological monitoring products are cost-prohibitive for most fire and emergency service agencies, and 50% of firefighter deaths are due to sudden cardiac events, this technology offers fire-service agencies an affordable mechanism for addressing this critical problem. Multiple studies have shown that early detection of an irregular heart-rate event (arrhythmias) offers a significant advantage in preventing and treating further CVD. The proposed technological innovation would consist of a wearable physiological monitoring device, which will use a range of networking mechanisms to communicate with a user-friendly analytical platform. Further, the integration of a self-alert system into a wearable patch would support a standalone operation even if there were to be a communication lag between a firefighter and command center. Early detection of arrhythmias and promoting corrective actions could reduce each individual cardiovascular disability claim by about $325,000.

    The proposed project aims to reduce the economic and social costs associated with firefighter injuries and fatalities due to underlying cardiovascular-disease and the extreme physiological strain resulting from the hazardous occupational environments in which fire services personnel work. The affordability of the proposed technology would not only improve occupational safety in the industry, but also enable scientists to further scientific knowledge about the interrelationships between oxygen saturation, ECG values, and extreme heat and physiological stress by using this technology to conduct experimental and field-based research. The longitudinal analysis possible with this platform would also give scientists the tools necessary to research the relationships between physiological stress and human performance factors, to gain a deeper understanding about critical factors in mechanisms such as decision making, risk perception, and communication. These factors are frequently cited in National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) after incident investigations of firefighter fatalities, along with playing important roles in the operating procedure standards set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new class of soft, flexible, nonabrasive sensing elements which provides precise temperature readings to positively impact the health and mobility of diabetic patients. The principle impetus of this research is to focus primarily on advanced diabetic patients who suffer from nerve damage to their feet. These patients cannot feel their feet, leading to two important and related results. First, they are at high risk for an increased number of undetected ulcerating injuries from tissue damage produced by walking (friction) or standing (pressure). Second, since these injuries are undetected and unfelt, there is a decreased urgency by the patient to seek medical care. Delays in medical intervention further exacerbate injuries and complicate treatment, leading to an economic burden associated with foot ulceration estimated at $15 billion annually. More importantly, the 5-year mortality rate after first ulceration (40%) approaches mortality rates from heart failure (50%). The key need for a simple and cost-effective ulcer-prevention paradigm is a safe, easy-to-use foot monitoring system with temperature-sensing capability with a remote readout.

    The proposed project utilizes an innovative approach to develop a non-invasive sensing system that will provide the ability to constantly monitor skin temperature that would be integrated into a diabetic-friendly insole. Skin temperature has been shown to be a predictive indicator of foot-ulcer development and can additionally be used as a measure of wound healing. A simple system enabling early detection of imminent skin ulceration subsequently reduces further tissue damage, decreasing limb amputations and saving financial, medical and emotional resources. The proof of concept shoe insert is designed to reside daily in a patient's shoes to continuously record the patient's foot health. In addition, the software system, including a mobile app for users as well as a doctor dashboard, is developed as a communication channel between the patient, the healthcare provider and the caregiver.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project aims to create and test a game-based intelligent
    tutoring system that both assesses and improves the behavioral readiness and social
    emotional skills of Kindergarten and 1st grade students. Research has shown that
    early intervention for children with social skill deficiencies is critical for
    success in the classroom and success in life. Children from vulnerable, underserved
    social niches are particularly likely to be 'less ready' for school, including
    those who experience poverty, family instability, and trauma, each of which disproportionately
    impact children from racial and ethnic minority groups. The game being developed
    by this project empowers educators to provide that much needed social emotional
    learning support for their young students. First, it provides an affordable, feasible,
    and scaleable means for identifying the social emotional needs of young students
    as they transition to formal schooling. Second, it enables educators to quickly
    translate this formative assessment data into personalized, digital intervention
    that can be applied with K1 students on a much broader scale than is possible
    with traditional, in-person services. And lastly, because this innovation is game-based
    and fun, students are more likely to fully engage and fully benefit from the embedded
    instruction. \n\n\nThis project will advance understanding of how an Intelligent
    Tutoring System (ITS) can be used effectively to help educators provide social
    emotional instruction to all students. Within academic domains such as science
    and mathematics, many successful ITS implementations have employed learning models
    where answers to problems and the knowledge being evaluated can be easily represented.
    However, traditional ITS techniques have not been as effective in domains like
    social emotional learning, where the connection between what a student does and
    what the student knows is less well-defined. This project will develop several
    significant innovations for ITS that apply to social and emotional learning, but
    may also be useful in other, less well-defined learning domains. These innovations
    are represented by our adaptive Student Model and Tutorial Manager which collectively
    enhance student learning via personalization, pacing, and engagement. As more
    student data is collected, the student model will become increasingly accurate,
    leading to more intelligent choices from the tutorial manager to better enhance
    the social tutoring of our innovation and thereby, student learning. In addition
    to addressing significant societal and market needs, research findings from this
    SBIR will be published to more broadly inform the efforts of the ITS community.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase II project will enable the development of the first known commercial medical ultrasound device utilizing air-coupled Capacitive Micromachine Ultrasound Transducer (CMUT) technology to diagnose otitis media. Otitis media is the number one indication for which antibiotics are prescribed for children, and the number one cause for surgery in childhood, costing $15+B annually in the US and resulting in 30M annual doctor visits in the US alone. Clinical studies show a diagnostic error rate averaging 50%. Today's tools are unable to accurately determine the presence, and much less the type, of effusion in the middle ear. This leads to significant over- prescription of antibiotics, over-referrals to specialists, and unnecessary surgeries. OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc. is developing a simple and sensitive medical device to provide diagnostic data to quickly and accurately diagnose both presence and type of otitis media.

    The work of this project will establish fast and economical assessment of CMUT sensor manufacturing performance, by electrical and acoustic measurements. OtoNexus will design and construct test systems to rapidly evaluate electrical and acoustical performance of CMUT sensors as an assessment of production quality. The Electrical Vector Impedance (EVI) test fixture provides an electrical surrogate measure for acoustic output, which can be performed rapidly at the wafer-level with 100% sampling. The Acoustic Output Measure (AOM) test fixture evaluates the pressure emitted by CMUT, and other acoustic performance parameters, after speculum final assembly. This project will develop test fixtures, methods, and processes for assessing production reliability and process consistency. The OtoNexus ultrasound device will be marketed to pediatricians and other primary care physicians, and will decrease prognostic uncertainty and resultant over-prescription of antibiotics, and place the tools for more accurate diagnosis into the hands of the very first clinician the patient sees. This will reduce costs by decreasing both antibiotic usage and specialist referrals and will also decrease required physician time by enabling a nurse or other physician extender to perform the test for otitis media.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a suite of screen-printed receive coils for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), that are flexible, lightweight, low-cost and adapted to the entire population from infants to adults. MRI is widely used to establish a broad variety of clinical diagnosis, but suffers from long examination times and a high rate of failure, resulting in a yearly loss of more than $4 billion in the United States alone. Printed receive coils are extremely flexible, lightweight, and conform well to the human body. With this technology, coils can be designed and manufactured inexpensively to fit all patient sizes, thus improving image quality and enabling robust acceleration of the method. These benefits can contribute to increase the success rate of MRI exams, speed up procedure time, enhance the clinical workflow, and reduce equipment costs. Printed coils will improve the quality of care offered by MRI suites and increase the availability and use of MRI to a wider patient population. Overall, this project will develop a clinical-ready system capable of delivering the full economic and clinical benefits of printed coils, which will contribute to a reduction of the healthcare costs associated with MRI.

    This project aims to fully realize a clinical-ready system consisting of a collection of printed, flexible lightweight MRI coil arrays, and connecting to a single universal cable to interface with the MRI scanner. A first part of the project will focus on the design of the cable and the associated connection scheme allowing interchange of multiple printed coil arrays of different sizes. Different strategies will be examined with the intent of maintaining high performance and safety while maximizing the advantages brought by printing. A second project goal will focus on the development of a collection of printed coil arrays for patient sizes ranging from newborn to adult, that are compatible with the universal cable and for both 3T and 1.5T scanners. The arrays will be designed for body imaging and will consist of 32-channel devices divided into 16-channel posterior and anterior portions. Their performance will be compared to a commercial 32-channel product. The final system will meet all the safety requirements for medical use and will be ready to be manufactured at scale.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a new tool for the analysis of in situ indican precursor in indigo plants, which when combined with genomic analysis and genetic linkage mapping in selectively bred indigo crops, will lead to high indican yielding breeding parental lines and ultimately competitively price natural indigo dye.  Additionally, characterization of genetic markers will accelerate further crop improvement by understanding and harnessing the genes crucial to indican synthesis and other aspects of significance to overall indigo yield. These advancements will benefit customers, denim mills, by leading to a more reliable, lower cost plant-derived indigo supply. The success of this multiphase STTR project will enable a cost-competitive, cleaner, and more sustainable denim dyeing process, while greatly expanding the market for domestically produced natural indigo.  Commercialization of a more consistent and higher yielding US-grown indigo plant that produces high purity indigo powder can replace the current standard of synthetic, imported indigo powder. While in demand by the marketplace today, plant-derived indigo is currently only used in premium denim products due to the high cost per pound resulting from low yields per plant per acre. The direct result of this research will be to open new market segments and expand existing market penetration for US-grown and manufactured biobased indigo for the textile industry, an addressable market of $1.86B. The methods and technology developed through this project have a direct path to the commercial marketplace and the industry is ready to support biobased textile dyes such as plant-derived indigo.

    During this project, reference genome resources will be constructed for indigo feedstock crops, F1 mapping populations will be constructed for P. tinctoria, I. tinctoria, and I. suffruticosa varieties, and design of the handheld rapid assay device will be validated through laboratory analysis. The reference genome for I. suffruticosa will be built using Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing and assembly.  In addition to this reference genome, whole-genome resequencing will be performed on available I. suffruticosa and I. tinctoria varieties.  Nucleotide variation and variant effect prediction will be made between the Indigofera-based indigo varieties.  This variation will be used to develop markers to evaluate intervarietal crosses. Controlled greenhouse crosses of three species will be made to create F1 mapping populations for use in constructing a genetic map and linkage mapping, in combination with the resources developed.  Intraspecies varieties exhibiting distinct phenotypic traits of commercial interest or notable dye yield differences will be selected for crossing to generate the F1 populations. Results from laboratory-based fluorometry equipment will be evaluated for efficacy and then compared against extractive indigo dye analysis from the leaf biomass.  A final prototype will be constructed based on these findings and validated through use in the laboratory and in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can lead to a revolution in 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces at the micron-scale range. The proposed technology will significantly improve photorealistic rendering in digital prototyping, and therefore reduce the waste from using physical material samples during design, engineering, and manufacturing. This technology will help reduce product development time and cost, and lead to a greater sustainability.

    The proposed project will develop a computational imaging system that allows for high-resolution 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces. The current approaches for 3D surface measurement at the micron scale are based on sophisticated optical and mechanical components that are expensive and can be difficult to use, and most of these approaches cannot capture the full appearance of a surface, such as diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and surface roughness. The goal of this research program is to develop a combination of hardware and software that can measure 3D surface microgeometry and reflectance properties with micron-scale accuracy. The proposed technology is expected to achieve superior performance at greatly reduced cost.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is multilayered. First, there is the potential for creation
    of a carbon nanotubes manufacturing industry in the United States that will create
    hundreds of high-paying domestic manufacturing jobs advance U.S. leadership and
    knowledge in industrial electrochemistry. Secondly, Saratoga Energy's technology
    has the potential to benefit the United States economy by increasing the cost-competitiveness
    and performance of lithium-ion batteries, paving the way to the broader adoption
    of electric vehicles and grid/renewable energy storage. In turn, this will help
    reduce the strategic importance of oil, the cost of securing global oil supplies,
    as well as greenhouse gas emission. While lithium-ion batteries are the focus
    of this body of work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are also used in a variety of other
    applications - advanced composite materials, nanotechnology, catalyst supports,
    water filtration, and other areas of commercial impact. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II
    project proposes to 1) electrochemically characterize carbon nanotubes as a cathode
    conductive additive for high-performance lithium-ion battery applications and
    2) construct a small pilot-scale carbon nanotube manufacturing unit capable of
    producing 1 kg of product per day for retail distribution. Saratoga Energy Research
    Partners, LLC (Saratoga Energy), has developed a high-selectivity electrochemical
    process to convert carbon dioxide into carbon nanotubes. In the work conducted
    thus far, Saratoga Energy has established that its carbon nanotubes can be manufactured
    at a cost ~50X cheaper than the market price for state-of-the-art battery-grade
    carbon nanotubes.  Battery manufacturers use carbon nanotubes to enable the reduction
    of conductive additive content in the cathode, thus improving specific and volumetric
    energy density. Carbon nanotubes also act as a reinforcing agent in the electrodes
    improving their mechanical properties. This is important for the battery assembly
    process but also for battery life performance, as the carbon nanotube network
    maintains a high level of cohesion of the electrodes upon repeated charge-discharge
    cycles. However, today, the high price of commercial carbon nanotubes limits their
    use, which will be addressed by our lower cost CNTs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be observed through a direct reduction in
    the energy consumption required by large industrial facilities, commercial buildings,
    campuses, and homes. Due to reduced cooling demands as a result of carefully designed
    radiative properties, the sustainability of federal and industry facilities will
    be significantly improved with the installation of passive radiative composite
    (PRC) roofing material for building energy management. The market demand for cool
    roofing materials has exceeded $1 Billion, annually, and is expected to grow with
    increasing need and return on investment. PRC roofing material can expect to compete
    in a growing industry due to non-trivial improvement over state-of-the-art options
    in commercial cool roofing products and the economic fabrication method identified
    in the PRC conceptual design stage. Opportunities extend beyond structural thermal
    management to a variety of cooling needs including refrigerated transportation
    and storage. The development of PRC roofing will advance understanding and use
    of spectrally-selective materials designed for intelligent control of thermal
    radiation. \n\nThe proposed project will provide critical design, testing, and
    experimental validation needed to transition PRC technology into the commercial
    sector. Designs based on electromagnetic and thermal modeling include composite
    material options capable of providing passive radiative flux of over 100 Watts
    per square meter of installed material. This passive cooling advantage, relative
    to current commercial cool roofing materials, is expected to create significant
    long-term cost savings and reduction in fossil fuel usage for climate controlled
    structures. PRC material properties designed to be spectrally selective offer
    the opportunity for intelligent thermal management through reflection of solar
    and near-infrared portions of the radiative spectrum, while emitting strongly
    in the 8-13 micron atmospheric transmission window. A primary objective of the
    SBIR project is to optimize PRC designs considering full spectrum properties with
    three criteria in mind: thermal efficiency improvement, durability, and large
    batch manufacturing economy. Demonstration of PRC-based roofing materials on full-scale
    test structures will quantify passive cooling power and robustness to weathering,
    positioning PRC-based roofing for introduction by a commercial manufacturing partner.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-level inverter, an integrated 100kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that will open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy. The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform the lives and future economic opportunities of young people and their communities through democratized access to cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Daily life, economies, innovation, and national security all depend on having a strong and skilled STEM workforce. For this workforce to exist, our schools must provide the necessary education and experience to prepare students for such careers. Unfortunately, a vast majority of K-12 educators today are not equipped with the resources to do so successfully. The importance of solving this problem cannot be overstated; developing a plentitude of competent STEM professionals is critical to ensure economic and security stability. These project goals are aligned with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense. The resulting technology innovation is of potential service to more than 50 million primary and secondary school students and 3.5 million educators nationally, with an ability to impact their course of study, improve STEM outcomes, increase hands-on project-based experience, and improve future economic opportunities.


    This technology innovation emerges at the intersection of cloud-based software technology, real-time collaboration tools, and learning management systems. This reimagined technology tool easily connects, attracts, and fosters delivery of cross-curricular, educational computing literacy resources aligned with national and state educational standards. The project aims to empower and support educators and students in tackling the many new opportunities and growing number of resources in computer science (CS) and engineering education at home, in classrooms, and in community centers. As the CS education landscape evolves with new and exciting technical curriculum, this innovation analyzes the willingness of educators to create or adopt new computer science education, the effectiveness of real-time collaboration tools on CS education outcomes, and measures student awareness and feelings about computer science and engineering disciplines. This technology innovation promotes customer participation and a unique ability to provide support at the ground level in real-time. There are solutions that provide massive online CS courses and curricula; however, none targeting K-12 classrooms or educators which support and integrate cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Offering cloud-based, synchronous technology tools this technology enables real-time, expert mentoring and pair-programming in a K12 virtual learning environment on a massive scale.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase overall crop health and production with the proposed smartphone compatible crop health sensor. More specifically, crop disease remains a significant threat to global food security, and with the ability to perform pre-visual screening, the proposed platform enables cost efficient, quantitative detection of crop disease, empowering farmers to take action to reduce disease impact. Initially the sensor platform provides a timely solution for cost effective, high throughput, and pre-visual screening of citrus Huanglongbing disease (HLB), enabling citrus growers to effectively manage HLB in their groves and remain profitable. The pre-visual, cost efficient and quantitative detection capability also translates to detection of diseases in other crops. In addition, the sensing technology developed can be used for quantitative assessment of crop nutrient and water stress, enabling farmers to optimally manage crop health, providing a means to optimize profits, increase crop yields, and reduce environmental impacts. This is critical to ensuring national and global food security, and protecting national water supplies by reducing eutrophication of water bodies due to misdiagnosis and mistreatment of crop stressors.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is built upon Atoptix?s patented compact self-referenced spectrophotometer design, which reduces the size and cost of an optical spectrophotometer to enable field use and integration with smartphone technology. For each spectral measurement, the sensor simultaneously records a self-referenced spectrum, retaining the sensitivity and reliability generally reserved for costlier and bulkier spectrophotometer designs, but also enabling a non-technical user to collect data in the field at the push of a button. Distinct from surface reflection methods, the proposed sensor enables pre-visual detection of a pathogen, as it only captures light that has penetrated inside of a leaf and interacted with internal structures. By lowering the cost of the optical sensor through patented designs, increasing ease of use via a smartphone, and joining the precision of optical spectroscopy with machine learning based analytics, the proposed sensor can enable widespread adoption by growers in disease prone regions, where community wide screening is key for protecting grower assets.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project addresses the need to reduce the time associated
    with conducting tests currently used to establish targeted antibiotic (and dose)
    to treat infections.  Sepsis and septic shock are one of the leading contributors
    to death in US Hospitals, responsible for 250,000 deaths annually (estimated at
    30-50% of all hospital deaths).  To combat these high death rates, time is of
    the essence.  The administration of targeted (versus broad-spectrum) antibiotic
    therapy in the first five to six hours of septic shock increases the likelihood
    of survival by roughly fifty percent.  This project combines electronics and microchannel
    fluidics to rapidly obtain results on antibiotic susceptibility.  The project
    requires engineering, software development, and method development, resulting
    in an instrument that utilizes disposable cards to conduct the testing.  The resulting
    product will allow transition from broad spectrum to targeted antibiotic therapy
    faster (1 day - weeks), leading to major benefits: (1) patient outcomes are greatly
    improved by faster transition to directed antibiotic therapy; (2) Reduced hospitalization
    stays (reduced intensive care stays), resulting in significant monetary saving
    for healthcare systems (estimated at a cost savings of at least $3.75B annually).
    \ (3) Reduced broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy reduces the current fostering
    of antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings globally. \n\nThis project uses
    Microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS) to measure the \"bulk capacitance\"
    (Cb) of a suspension. Cb is a measure of the amount of charge transiently accumulated
    at the membranes of living cells in a suspension. Cell proliferation results in
    an increase in Cb, whereas cell death results in a decrease.  Using m-EIS to measure
    bacteria in the presence of candidate antibiotics and doses, is robust, sensitive,
    and extremely fast, determining, in real time, cell growth, stasis, or death (in
    approximately 4 hrs).  This project will develop a rapid, direct-from-sample,
    inexpensive commercial system. This is achieved by using commercial MNPs to isolate
    microorganisms from clinical samples such as blood culture broth, urine, sputum
    etc., and re-suspending the pathogens in specified volumes of growth media to
    obtain a suspension containing optimized concentrations of bacteria.  Pathogen
    growth or death is then monitored using m-EIS in microfluidic cards where they
    are exposed to a range of antibiotic concentrations. The result is a phenotypic
    antibiotic susceptibility (AST) profile, yielding the minimal inhibitory concentration
    (MIC) of multiple candidate antibiotics within 4 hours of sample collection. The
    AST and MIC information is then used to treat infections with targeted therapeutic.
    \ The first products utilizing this system/method will focus on urine and positive
    blood culture broth samples.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
    has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of applications, including smart buildings, home automation, and security. The development of this new technology for efficient indoor sensing, and development of new algorithms for occupancy sensing and counting techniques, will have immediate implications in the building automation and home construction industries, where improved occupancy sensing is necessary to achieve the promise of Smart Buildings that adjust environmental conditions such as lighting and air conditioning automatically to suit the needs of the occupants. Implementing this false-alarm free technology will realize millions of dollars in cost savings from reduced energy use. Such energy savings would impact the US energy independence while helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to "smart building"/energy efficiency applications there are also significant opportunities to apply these highly-reliable and difficult-to-defeat sensors to facility security, military, law-enforcement/correctional facilities and in-home care monitoring. This project represents Broadening Participation: As a woman-owned minority business in an underrepresented geographical location (Hawaii), the success of Adnoviv will bring opportunity for graduate students through our relationship with the University of Hawaii and encourage young girls to enter Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will result in a revolutionary advance in occupancy sensing for smart buildings and energy-use reduction by providing a low-cost sensor capable of real human presence detection and occupant count and eliminating the issues that have limited the utility of occupancy sensors in many applications. The feasibility of using radio frequency Doppler radar to detect human cardiopulmonary activity and estimate number of occupants using a low power system-on-chip (SoC) platform will be demonstrated. In particular, reliable occupant detection without false alarms, and occupant count estimation will be investigated to further enhance energy savings potential, especially in conjunction with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. The significant commercial potential of such True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors in energy-saving applications will be demonstrated in partnership with one of the largest building automation companies in the world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address two societal needs. It will enable mass charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) at minimal cost, and will enable the provisioning of energy services to help integrate renewable energy
    sources. This is critical as electricity generation and transportation together consume close to two-thirds of all US energy and emit more than half of all US greenhouse gases. To drastically reduce greenhouse gases will therefore require electrification of our
    transportation and renewable generation of our electricity. California (CA) has a mandate to have 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles by 2025 and, currently, half of the nation's EVs are in CA. If the project is successful, the proposed technology, when deployed at scale,
    can potentially save CA $144M annually in operating costs and $1.1B in capital cost when CA reaches its ambitious goal by 2025. This can help reduce greenhouse gases annually in CA by 5.5 million metric tons. This project will therefore make an impact in both clean
    transportation and clean energy.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop an adaptive EV charging system that can implement a number of innovations that are not currently available in the EV charging industry. It will offer a site host a solution to recover costs,
    jointly optimize onsite distributed energy resources such as solar panels and battery banks, minimize operating cost for site host and charging cost for drivers, and optimally trade off preferences and constraints of different drivers and of the site host, subject to
    infrastructure capacity constraints. These technologies will be based on unique real-time sensing, communications, and control capabilities, as well as advanced optimization and learning algorithms. These technologies will provide a target charging capacity at minimal infrastructure and operating costs, as well as a platform for energy services to the grid.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to allow for the recycling of valuable materials from
    complex wastes that today cannot be recovered. The commercial impact from this
    innovation is to allow for complex waste streams that contain multiple materials,
    such as textiles, to serve as the source of raw materials for the manufacture
    of new goods in a way that is cost advantaged. This gives those businesses that
    use such raw materials a sustainable alternative and importantly, a lower-cost,
    efficiently produced material. In this way, there will be significant incentive
    for the reuse of thousands of tons of material that today either goes to landfills,
    oceans, or is incinerated for energy, a very low value application. A funded,
    successful project will yield an entirely new framework for recycling of complex,
    multi-component materials.    \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop
    novel technologies for fractionating complex wastes. Multi-component wastes such
    as textiles represent upwards of 4% of total landfill volume. Today, there does
    not exist technology for recovering the high-value materials that are in these
    wastes. The proposed project intends to develop a new approach using chemical
    techniques as opposed to simple melt recycling to enable the value-added recycling
    of high value polymers from such wastes. Chemical process development will take
    place in order to take the current status of the technology to implementation
    in a pilot plant. The main technical objective of the proposal is to develop the
    process so as to produce large amounts of consistent, high purity product. Materials
    such as polyester and nylon cannot be separated from natural or cellulosic fibers
    such as cotton or other textile materials. The goals of the research are to develop
    the proposers' current process for fractionating the synthetic resins with an
    emphasis on achieving high purity products at larger volumes. To this end, various
    chemistry and chemical engineering techniques will be investigated for exclusion
    of impurities from end product polymer at the kg scale.\n\nThis award reflects

Many solutions are focused on getting information to the vehicle, while it is often the infrastructure that requires vehicle information to operate more efficiently. Currently, traffic signals enforce the right-of-way of everyone regardless of in-vehicle technology. This is why optimizing their effects on the road network can provide tremendous benefit. There are significant benefits to transit as well, like buses and light rail that, when given priority at intersections, improves on-time performance which is a major factor in ridership rates.

    The proposed project advances the work of the joint standardization of the National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol (NTCIP) to achieve interoperability between various traffic signal controller vendors to enable shared control and organization between different operating agencies. It is not unusual to have sections of roadway be managed by local, county, and state within the same small area. These overlapping jurisdictions produce fractures within the road network resulting in the asynchronous timing of traffic signals. The aim is to consolidate the management into a signal network capable of coordinating large areas of traffic signals to increase mobility's overall efficiency. With a cloud solution that is capable of speaking to each networked intersection, vehicle telemetry data and route information can be used to proactively optimize signal timing. Working with prioritized vehicles such as buses, fire trucks, and ambulances, pilot studies will be conducted to perform priority and preemption along routes that cross jurisdictions. Each pilot case will be analysed based on key performance indicators set forth by the agencies.

    This SBIR Phase II project will benefit society by reducing the cost of manufacturing biologic pharmaceuticals and improving their quality, including pharmaceuticals that are currently too costly to manufacture because they target relatively small patient populations. In order to accelerate the availability of newly discovered drugs, the pharmaceutical industry and federal regulatory agencies have identified a great need for advances in process analytical technologies (PATs) in biomanufacturing. This project will advance state-of-the-art PAT by providing a continuous in-situ sensor enabling novel methods of drug quality assurance. This multi-analyte sensor will allow biopharmaceutical companies, for the first time, to monitor the concentration of the product in-situ as it is being produced along with the concentrations of other important cell culture conditions. This ability unlocks new avenues for optimizing biopharmaceutical production which consumes about 35% of the biologic drug cost-of-goods. Efficient control of upstream processes using sensors such as the one proposed here is expected to reduce these costs by up to 30%. Furthermore, this technology can be directed towards other analytes by replacing the bound affinity ligands. Thus, this technology can be used as a sensing platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing or medical diagnostics, food processing, and water quality monitoring.

    This project will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing, hydrogel chemistry, and process analytics by developing the first continuous monoclonal antibody (mAbs) sensor suitable for biomanufacturing. Remarkable progress has been made in developing affinity ligands that specifically bind to targets, but thus far the primary application has been medical therapeutics. This project will develop a biosensor adapting affinity ligands, aptamers in particular, for the first time for application in bioprocess monitoring. This will be accomplished by synthesizing the first antibody-responsive hydrogel containing covalently attached peptide aptamers. Each of the four objectives will focus on hydrogels, electronics, software and system validation respectively. The mAb biosensor will be capable of monitoring quality and yield of mAbs besides the key parameters: pH, osmolality, glucose, and lactate in cell culture environments. This novel hydrogel will be the basis for the first in-situ bioreactor sensor for real-time antibody measurements during biomanufacturing. This adaptable technology can be leveraged towards a number of protein targets; thus, this project represents a transformative approach that will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing across a multitude of applications. Thus, the proposed sensor array will be a powerful tool to advance process analytics and biomanufacturing.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a personalized learning environment for guiding students in effective use of educational sketching in Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM). There is an estimated need for 1 million more STEM professionals in the U.S. over the next decade. However, the dropout rate for students in STEM majors ranges from 48% to 69%. Recent reform in mathematics education in the U.S. has focused on sketching and modeling so that students have a better understanding of the problems they are solving rather than rote memorization. Sketching is also important for improving the ability to visualize three dimensional shapes in engineering, medicine, and science. Teaching sketching has been shown to increase retention in STEM by over 50% among students entering college with low spatial visualization skills, especially among women and other underrepresented minorities. However, the traditional method of sketching on paper requires teaching expertise and classroom time, which has limited its use. Our touchscreen software will improve upon sketching on paper, by providing immediate feedback and intelligent hints when students are stuck. A key advantage of our approach is that it can reward persistence by having students retry a sketching assignment until they get it right, as opposed to multiple-choice questions that can only be tried once. Impact will include improved conceptual understanding in K-6 mathematics and STEM education at all levels.


    This project will develop an intelligent learning environment where students can freehand sketch on a touchscreen phone, tablet, or computer. They will receive personalized feedback based on the sketches they draw to improve their conceptual understanding and promote persistence. The software algorithms developed will automatically grade student sketches and provide hints that are just enough to keep the student engaged but not so much as to give away the solution. An expert teacher knows that developing skill and increasing persistence requires that students struggle a bit as they overcome obstacles to learn new concepts. The algorithm for interpreting student sketches and providing hints will mimic an expert teacher looking over the shoulder of the student. By interpreting student intent in their sketches, the algorithm will be able to distinguish between intentional marks and unintentional ones that are due to poor coordination or sloppiness. Subject areas include elementary school mathematics, spatial visualization for 7-12th grade technical education, post-secondary vocational and engineering programs, and eventually physics, geology, medicine and other STEM areas. This project will replace sketching on paper and pencil with widely available touchscreens, and make educational sketching more effective and engaging.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a drug delivery technology to address the unmet need of antiproliferative drug delivery below-the-knee. In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles.

    This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes development of berry post-picking screening and handling that will provide a safe and efficient way to remove contaminated berries from the processing stream of an automated harvester. The project will advance machine vision technology for robotic harvesting and will be a key enabling technology leading to acceptance of automated harvesting as safe and effective. The market sector addressed by this project is strawberry farmers, though the technology will be applicable to other types of fruit and vegetable farming as well. The automated harvesting technology advanced by this project will alleviate chronic and worsening labor shortages faced by strawberry farmers and will ensure that strawberries remain affordable and available to consumers. Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize a transparent, thin multifunctional coating for corrosion and biofouling prevention on coated surface. Its environmentally friendly product will be an efficient ready-to-use single component product that can be applied with ease, and would dry in ambient conditions without the need for external heating equipment. The global annual expenditure to mitigate corrosion is in the range of $2.5 trillion, roughly equal to 3.4% of the world's GDP. Protecting assets from corrosion is, hence, a critical requirement for all the industries. A broad range of applications can benefit from this coating technology such as aviation industry where removal of toxic chromium compounds from coating procedures is of high priority, automobile manufacturing where extended corrosion protection to vehicles without using toxic treatments is constantly sought, structural engineering where providing long life protection to bridges is always needed, marine engineering where protecting ships from corrosion and not contributing to ecological imbalance is long sought, military where minimizing the maintenance downtime of tanks and guns is of prime importance, hospitals that are interested in longer lasting medical implants, and paints and coating industry that is desiring removal of volatile organic components from their paints and coatings. The proposed coating is expected to offer scratch resistance and oleophobic characteristics in addition to corrosion protection. The initial success of this project will result in two high-volume products.


    This project aims to develop a specialized single-part, ready-to-use, nominally bioceramic liquid coating for protection against corrosion and fouling activities. On application over desired surface, this transparent liquid transforms into hard-yet-flexible coating. This thin coating composition consists of in-place generated nanoparticles of organometallic compounds in the 3D network of polysilsesquioxane. The reactivity of the precursor to coating is designed such that material can react with substrates in ambient conditions and dries to solid film without the need of any external heating. The hardened coating adheres to most surfaces including metals, ceramics, plastics, glasses, and wood. The optimum thickness of coating is approximately ten microns and can impart various desired surface functionalities to the coated object. In this project, efforts are directed towards optimization of current composition to be compatible with broad range of commercially available topcoat materials. The optimized coating composition will be subjected to a rapid properties screening before third party testing, validation and approvals. An extensive field testing will be conducted in collaboration with potential customers. This innovative coating technology will initially result into two products that can be used in place of carcinogenic hexavalent chromium compounds that are currently in use for the corrosion protection of metals. While one of the products would act as a corrosion prevention compound that can adhere to commercial topcoat paints, the other would act as self-cleaning coating to prevent biofouling activities.

    This STTR Phase II project supports standards-based math education in elementary school classrooms with a hands-on technology intervention. Research has shown that many elementary teachers suffer from low confidence and limited subject content knowledge in math and struggle to develop instruction designed to meet or exceed common core math learning goals. Teachers and researchers alike seek new approaches to engage students and improve teacher effectiveness to improve learning outcomes. The primary goal of this project is the development of a flexible, user-friendly, hands-on robotics kit with associated curriculum and support for teachers, that will engage students in learning math content, align with core curriculum, and measurably increase student achievement. The commercialization of this research-based classroom kit will enable school districts to adopt active learning into their math pedagogy. Ultimately, this promotes the NSF mission to increase national prosperity through science innovation by improving math preparation for students across the United States and preparing them to participate in careers that drive the advancement of science and technology.


    The core contribution of this work is composed of a flexible hardware kit to enable active learning within the core elementary curriculum as well as more traditional maker activities, and a suite of apps that allow students to use this kit to learn specific math content while also providing options to learn computational thinking through general purpose programming apps. To accomplish this, the team employs a proven design process in which hardware, software, and curriculum are simultaneously designed to align to learner goals, evaluated in classroom studies, and iteratively refined. The kit will combine the ease of use and simplicity of a regular snap-together style electronics kit with the flexibility of a programmable microcontroller. The apps developed for this project will build on a new math-based paradigm for robot programming. These math-oriented apps will remove the barrier of programming skills for elementary teachers and students alike when using the electronics kit for math instruction. Simultaneously, programming apps will enable open-ended explorations of making and computational thinking. Another contribution of this project will be the testing and analysis of the hardware system and complementary math curricula. Formative evaluation will enable exploration and understanding of novel mechanisms for learning math, and evaluation of the program's efficacy will enable characterization of the impact on student outcomes in math achievement and attitudes towards math.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a video-based safety system for improving
    the quality and reducing the cost of dementia care. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects
    5.4M in the US, including 1 in 9 over 65 and 1 in 3 over 85, and represents two
    thirds of all those affected by dementia. It is the single most expensive disease
    in the US ($236B direct; $221B indirect costs). The size of the US population
    with AD doubles every 15 years. The drug failure rate for AD is among the highest,
    currently 99.6. Fall accidents account for 26% of all AD related hospitalizations
    and are a major concern and key cost contributor, with an average fall rate of
    4 falls per year and 3 in 4 repeated falls. Unfortunately, safety products developed
    for falls were developed for cognitively aware adults and not designed specifically
    for individuals with AD. The proposed system will change the quality of care and
    operations in memory care facilities, increase quality of life for patients and
    families, and help the medical profession gain a better understanding of dementia.
    \n\n\nThe proposed project addresses this critical gap in Alzheimer's care by
    detecting safety critical events, based on camera video where events can be reviewed
    by a human assistant in real-time and after the fact. It is expected to achieve

    ability for our machine learning algorithms to automatically perform safety critical
    tasks, by learning over a sufficiently rich set of data. These extend existing
    methods for fall detection to include (a) fall prediction; (b) wandering detection;
    (c) bed sores detections; (2) enabling the Company to demonstrate that the system
    proposed can run with a fully operational HIL paradigm running at scale with up
    to 1000 patients in 100 memory care facilities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will usher new Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) products delivering high accuracy with explainability. Without rationale behind predictions, decision makers can't trust and effectively use AI/ML solutions.  Outcome of R&D through this project would lead to more accurate and faster detection with appropriate explanation of anomalous interactions and recommend effective controls to 1) eliminate billions of dollars of fraud, waste and abuse (FWA) in Health Insurance  markets;  2) lower costs, improve quality and speed of Health Care delivery to consumers; and 3) promote new markets in Personalized Health and Smart Health sector for  emerging Medical Internet-of-Things (IOT) devices and systems, enabling economic growth.  The results of this research are expected to enable the discovery of medical anomaly together with advancing the detection of new types of FWA. The boost in detection accuracy with explanation will save hundreds of millions of dollars. Societal impact includes reduced costs to consumers and taxpayers through better FWA control and advance health outcome through early medical IOT anomaly detection. More broadly, the system is expected to detect possible opioid or substance abuse epidemic cohorts, under/over-medication, advanced alerts for community health anomalies.

    The proposed project will extend and generalize a novel machine learning method to solve the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) problem in health insurance, coupled with explanatory capability providing rational behind predictions and operationalized in a distributed parallel computing framework for scaling. The technical problem is how to combine relations between entities (e.g., doctors) with their attribute (e.g., a doctor's prescription history). This project advances the state of the art by combining relations between rows in the training data (e.g. doctors) with standard machine learning to improve prediction accuracy while facilitating local explanation. The result is vastly improved prediction accuracy with explainability. Thus, the method uses network information to fill in the gaps of entity information alone and vice versa while facilitating explanation for a test case. This method is expected to significantly improve the ability to detect FWA and pave ways for multi Billion dollars savings, call out IOT-based medical anomaly in advance to improve health outcome and build trust in the predictions for the decision makers through the explanations provided. The team intends to deliver not only the accuracy boost with explainability, but a fully operational system with automated data pipeline, parallel and distributed algorithmic processing framework which can be deployed on a SaaS basis or an enterprise solution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be that this research will address the resolution and detection range requirements of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios. The next major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving, which will increase safety, mobility and productivity. Fully autonomous transportation may eliminate human error, the leading cause of traffic accidents, and could also lead to reduced traffic congestion, higher energy efficiency, and enhanced mobility for the aging and disabled population. The proposed advanced sensing system with intelligent algorithms is expected to help enable and advance the autonomous driving revolution. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact. The global market size of autonomous sensors is expected to grow from $5.2 billion in 2018 to $11.9 billion in 2023, with the radar-based sensor segment representing $2.9 billion in 2023. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancements in a number of important market sectors including wireless communications, sensing, mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to realize a 3D-printed Luneburg lens-based high performance automotive radar for autonomous driving. Existing automotive radars do not have enough distance detection, field of view, and angular resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving fully autonomous driving. As a result, current autonomous driving tests utilize LiDAR ((Light Detection And Ranging) systems which are more expensive and less reliable than radar especially under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, and smoke. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing, which is convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave Luneburg lenses. Based on the Luneburg lens?s ability to form multiple beams with high gain and broad bandwidth, a novel automotive radar will be designed by mounting radar detectors around the lens. Moreover, with the wide bandwidth and natural beam forming capabilities of the Luneburg lens, an adaptive sensing approach is proposed to improve the scanning efficiency and avoid interference from nearby or intruder radar systems. With these proposed approaches, the objective is to achieve a high performance and high value millimeter-wave sensing system suitable for autonomous transportation applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on using analytics and technology to benefit patients who require additional care to fully recover - or simply to maintain their health - after being discharged from the hospital. Whether subacute or community-based care, significant opportunity exists to leverage machine learning, decision science, and advance data mining techniques to better support patients. State and federal budgets cover the costs of care for millions of Americans every year. This expenditure is growing faster than inflation, prompting the development of both optional and mandatory payment reform efforts that stand to simultaneously reduce costs and improve care outcomes. If successful, this project will help reduce costs of care for healthcare providers, payers, and government/society.

    The proposed project aims to incorporate and improve upon user-centered decision science in healthcare. The proposed platform will combine advanced machine learning techniques with a patient/family-centered business model. The innovation will harness multiple streams of healthcare data, such as claims/billing data from acute, subacute, and community care settings. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics and outcomes measurement.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continually refine and move towards production of this project's Creative Maker Tool, an augmented reality experience where the act of playing is inherently inventing. The system uses modern technology to avoid digital screens. Throughout this experience, learners tap into their natural proclivities to make and shape ideas in the non-digital world, and develop the ability to fluently construct new ideas in a technical medium. The commercialization of this project will address two, nationally important issues. First, by scaffolding young learners through progressively bringing their ideas into reality, this project will foster creative confidence: the natural ability to come up with ideas and the courage to act on them. Next, there is a gender gap in innovation and entrepreneurship in the United States. Women patent at 40% the rate of men, only 9% of information technology related patents have one or more female inventors, and only 8% of the beneficiaries of incubators meant to commercialize innovations were women. This project will address gender equity issues in the maker community (currently 80% male) and by widening pathways to engage in making.


    The system is composed of a projection system that allows real-time programmable interactions between everyday and virtual objects without a computer screen. Throughout this research, we will create and refine STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) Apps, which are built-in augmented activities where users create small inventions with everyday objects to code interactions and affect program flow or gameplay, develop Augmented Tutorials, bridge seamlessly to existing STEM tools through real-time interfacing, as well as manufacture and prepare the system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that if successful, the results of this project will revolutionize large area LED array assembly manufacturing, leading to unprecedented growth of the direct view LED display market. Direct view LED displays, or video walls, are becoming more ubiquitous in everyday life. First only appearing in sports stadiums, they have gradually started appearing in retail advertising, and now are starting to appear in cinemas and control rooms. These types of displays are much brighter, have better contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and are more energy efficient than other competing display technologies. Despite these advantages, rate of adoption is very slow, limited by the cost and time required to make these displays. Current manufacturing tools are facing a bottleneck as display resolutions increase. A massively parallel assembly technology could drastically increase production speeds while reducing cost-of-goods. Additionally, the knowledge gained by the research into this self-assembly technology has the potential to unlock new opportunities in semiconductor packaging including lighting and concentrated solar.

    The proposed project seeks to speed-up the LED placement process by leveraging the parallel nature of directed self-assembly. Rather than placing individual LEDs into a grid-array as it is done today, this technology utilizes confining magnetic fields to quickly and simply arrange hundreds or thousands of LEDs into a neat and ordered grid-array. The objective is to achieve assembly speeds at least 5 times faster than conventional tools. The research will focus on the effects of LED size and geometry on accuracy, rate, and yield. Additionally,  new magnetic field stages to enhance assembly precision will be developed. The key anticipated results are (1) a system that will be able to rapidly assemble thousands of LED die with the precision necessary for high-resolution displays and (2) a fully operational LED display panel constructed with this technology to demonstrate the manufacturing potential of this technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project will create an industrial process for bonding ceramics to metals at the molecular level. Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available.


    The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems.

    This SBIR Phase II Project aims to tackle the two greatest barriers to technology adoption associated with metal additive manufacturing (AM) - cost and quantities. Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers' needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing.


    The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created. The 3DEO process is based on a novel combination of two low-tech and low cost, established technologies. The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science trough the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, completely re-designed sintering cycles and a lengthy evaluation of shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome. The goal of the proposed research is to fabricate powder metallurgy parts of adequate structural integrity to satisfy industrial end-use requirements.

    This SBIR Phase II effort will create transformative open tools to enable affordable access at scale to high quality assessments (problems & questions) for foundational subjects in secondary and post-secondary education. The explosion of online student audiences, rapid growth of Open Educational Resources (OER), and the need to support individual learners are creating an unprecedented demand for digital assessments. Assessment authoring tools today are controlled by large organizations, require advanced skills and proprietary assessment delivery platforms with restrictive collaboration features. This inequity is particularly pronounced with respect to technology-enabled assessments (TEAs) which are sophisticated, digital assessments that enable deeper learning. This effort will democratize the process of authoring and sharing TEAs through the creation of intuitive end user tools that will enable educators without advanced technical skills to author and share TEAs. This has the potential to disrupt the status quo by empowering educators to take charge of the assessment creation and distribution landscape with ground-breaking tools that enable easy authoring and distribution of sophisticated TEAs without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system. Eventually, this will empower educators at scale by triggering the evolution of a peer-to-peer marketplace around the need for assessments, and impact hundreds of thousands of learners in secondary and tertiary education settings.


    This project will follow through on two principal innovations. The first is an end-user tool that will dramatically reduce the time and expertise required to author technology-enhanced assessments. The tool will facilitate intuitive authoring of TEAs by using symbolic representation of programming constructs. The second innovation is a new standard for representation of technology-enhanced assessments that makes them usable in any delivery platform, thus making the assessments platform-neutral. This effort will also advance the frontiers of authoring beyond individual assessments to the creation of adaptive assessment pathways that will provide personalization for diverse learners. It will explore novel technologies including the representation of TEAs as intelligent and portable objects that are interoperable with disparate assessment platforms through application programming interfaces. The research studies will provide insight into how the proposed innovations can make authoring of TEAs more efficient while lowering the skills barrier for educators, and the degree to which such TEAs are effective in eliciting student reasoning and thinking processes in foundational subjects. This will be achieved through a combination of usability and validation studies in partnership with secondary and post-secondary educators drawn from different institutions.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize MRA arrays for
    use in 802.11ac/ax WLAN systems and 5G mm-wave systems based on new radio specifications.
    5G systems require exploitation of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
    technology with a large number of antennas to attain significantly improved spectral
    efficiency, thereby achieving required network capacities and enhanced connectivity.
    Massive MIMO is also needed to overcome severe propagation losses in mm-wave bands,
    where large swaths of spectrum is available. If a MIMO system uses legacy dumb
    antennas with fixed properties, the resulting complexity and cost figures, and
    the power consumption associated with a large number of RF front ends render them
    commercially prohibitive. The MRA array technology delivers 3-10 dB higher array
    gain compared to legacy arrays. Such gains can be used to improve RF coverage,
    increase user throughput, and reduce network costs by lowering the number of RF
    nodes or reduce the cost, size and power consumption of access point equipment
    by lowering the number of antenna elements. This project will deliver the beta

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are numerous and include commercial, societal, environmental, and educational impacts. Commercially, an innovation of this magnitude would enable flexible design illumination, with great control over light placement, beam shape, stray light, and light pollution, all while decreasing the size and complexity of the optics and fixtures required. This will impact the amount of electricity used for lighting, helping to reduce global energy consumption, preserve our environment, and create economic and societal benefits. This project will also result in the employment several technical personnel to carry out the project's technical goals. Educational outreach will continue to impact the local community, students and researchers at nearby institutions, as well as visitors through seminars and workshops on solid-state lighting, materials research, and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the technical results may also inform future materials research in the development of robust materials, components, and device architectures with optimal properties to advance other areas of solid-state lighting research.

    The proposed project is aimed at achieving deployment of laser-stimulated phosphor technology for illumination in the commercial marketplace. Research in the field of solid-state lighting is advancing towards the goal of ultra-efficient and smart lighting. Exploring laser-stimulated phosphor emission could lead to next generation, energy-efficient light sources, surpassing the limitations of current lighting technologies. Optical modeling and thermal simulations will be used to optimize the optics, phosphor materials, and device architectures to achieve narrow-beam angle, low-etendue, and high color-quality white light sources, while maintaining efficient operating temperature. Secondary components will be designed, including the electronics, packaging, heat sinks; compatibility tested with fixtures and manufacturing processes; and implementation into a light engine compatible in design and functionality with customer-specific applications. Regulatory, safety, and performance testing will be completed to achieve industry-specific standards, by working with regulatory bodies to test lifetime and durability in operating conditions, implementation of safety mechanisms, and photometric testing to ensure performance metrics. Lastly, planning, partnerships, execution, data collection, and reporting of field trail testing of products in real life conditions will result in a fully deployed and tested product, ready for implementation.

    from new services and features (such as automated product reordering) to better-designed products
    which more closely fit their needs. By enabling new use cases for wireless connectivity, this technology
    can prompt innovation across many industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project introduces a new long-range
    backscatter-based communication technology based on Chirp Spread Spectrum, a wireless protocol
    which can be detected at extremely low signal levels. The low-power wireless system prior to this
    project is comprised of three elements: A passive backscatter-based radio, a first gateway device which
    provides an illumination signal, and a second gateway device which receives the resulting
    backscattered data and forwards data to the Internet. In this project, the passive backscatter-based
    radio will be implemented in an integrated circuit form, realizing the low power and low cost possible
    with this technology. The two gateway devices will be combined into one full-duplex radio device, to
    address the needs of the majority of deployment scenarios. Techniques to localize the backscatter
    radios within the field of the gateway device will be explored. Finally, security challenges will be
    addressed and the system will undergo extensive evaluation and testing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will research and develop new functional materials for advanced additive manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop high performance materials for light activated 3D printers. If successful, this will enable new tools for manufacturing and research. Applications of this project would enable affordable, waste-free, and energy-efficient manufacturing with the goal of lowering barriers to innovation. Specifically, this project has the potential to improve the quality of healthcare around the world, by dramatically lowering the costs of designing and manufacturing biomedical devices.

    polySpectra has developed a new class of modular 3D printing resins, capable of manufacturing production-quality parts with tailored geometry and chemical functionality in a single step. This process is called ?functional lithography,? and it unlocks the ability to simultaneously define the form and function of advanced materials. The application of functional lithography to additive manufacturing enables production-ready parts to be directly 3D-printed, whereas existing materials can only make prototypes, mock-ups or toys. The goal of this project is to develop new advanced manufacturing processes using functional lithography, towards direct additive manufacturing of high-fidelity polymer components, devices and hardware.

- abstractText: "The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to treat chronic back and lower
    limb pain more effectively using a high-resolution stimulation technology.  Lower
    back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuro-modulation
    is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer
    from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional
    electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to
    the bulky paddle electrode volume associated with the legacy manufacturing processes.
    \ Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects
    during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode
    is positioned.  Many subjects undergo multiple operations due to inaccurate electrode
    alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.  The
    proposed active grid electrode technology seeks to double the size of therapeutic
    surface area, including providing therapy to low-back fibers which are not accessible
    by conventional electrodes.  The technology is expected to improve low-back pain
    relief, as well as use wireless programming to alter the therapy in the event
    of electrode movement, avoiding the need for re-operation.  \n\nThe proposed project
    seeks to double the area of the spinal cord which can receive therapeutic benefit,
    by developing an active stimulation-grid electrode grid technology.  By positioning
    a very small electronic circuit within the paddle electrode, the team is expected
    to create a 64 contact therapy array to deliver precision therapy.   To accomplish
    these goals, the project includes three critical tasks including:  (1) develop
    a medical-grade design of the implantable electronics, package, and lead array,
    (2) perform mechanical aging and stretch testing, and (3) prepare prototypes for
    subsequent ISO 14708 validation testing.  The goal of the project is to accelerate
    the medical-grade hardware development effort to enable future therapies to treat
    low-back pain.  Eventual validation after this project is completed will be performed
    in humans by selectively applying stimulation and recording if the patient feels
    therapy in the low-back area."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project on hospital service robots is improving the quality of care in hospital systems that are under increased pressure to provide high-quality patient-centric care while functioning as profitable businesses. Hospitals face a shortage of qualified nurses and high rates of nurse turnover. Nurses play a critical role in communicating care plans, educating patients, and guarding against medical errors. The amount of time they spend in direct care activities is a key determinant of patient satisfaction, better patient outcomes, fewer errors, and shorter lengths of stay. In the face of nursing shortages across the U.S., it is increasingly important to have nurses performing at the 'top of their license'. Reducing the amount of time they spend on non-nursing tasks is crucial to this goal. Automation could address these challenges and labor shortage by allowing clinical staff to focus on providing skilled care. The proposed project aims to develop technology that is general-purpose enough to transfer to other markets, such as long term care facilities and, eventually, individual consumers. Robots that perform assistive tasks in homes could increase the feasibility of independent living for many older adults.


    The proposed project will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of developing hospital service robots that act as assistants on acute care units, enabling nurses to spend more time at the bedside with patients. This project will make technical advances along three dimensions: the ability of the proposed robot to autonomously navigate within nursing units and across the hospital (navigation capabilities); to easily adapt its manipulation skills to specific tasks and to physical characteristics of a particular hospital/unit (adaptive learning of manipulation skills); and to work alongside humans in a socially acceptable manner, including appropriate navigation in crowded hallways, speech, and eye gaze behaviors that communicate the robot's intentions (socially intelligent interoperability). The team intends to collaborate closely with a single partner hospital to iteratively improve the reliability and robustness of the artificial intelligence software suite developed with NSF funding and to deploy production-quality versions of the three core competencies. The final 6 months will involve a long-term deployment, with the robot autonomously working on an acute care unit of the partner hospital. The impact of the robot on unit staff and workflows will be documented, with the ultimate goal of developing a service robot that hospital staff view as a competent member of the care team.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable and support the future development, approval, and clinical use of new therapeutics the cure HIV-1 infection.  HIV-1 infection can be controlled by available antiretroviral therapy, but cannot be cured due to the persistence of the virus in a quiescent, or latent state.  This latent HIV-1 is the barrier to curing infection.  While latent HIV-1 can be found in all infected individuals, it is present in very low frequencies.  To cure HIV-1 infection, new therapeutics that eliminate latent HIV-1 must be developed.  This development is hindered by current lack of a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in infected individuals.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and optimize a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in the blood of infected individuals.  Current tests used in research laboratories to measure latent HIV-1 are either non-specific or require large volumes of blood and many days to complete.  This project is focused on developing a new molecular test that specifically measures latent HIV-1 from a minimal volume of blood in hours.  Specifically, the project is focused on defining initial test performance and developing critical assay controls needed for robust performance of this new molecular test for latent HIV-1.  Successful completion of this project will yield a latent HIV-1 test prototype that can be advanced to market to support research and early-stage clinical trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a user-friendly asthma management solution. The asthma management tool consists of a portable medical device and mobile app combination that measures lung function with the consistency and accuracy of a trained lab technician, displaying current asthma status, and providing health insights to act upon. During the 2-year duration of this proposal, the applicant will further develop a machine-learning algorithm that obtains the same level of consistency and accuracy as if a trained lab technician were coaching and correcting the asthmatic patient on proper usage. Steps will be taken to establish the efficacy of such technology through verification of classification by pulmonologists. In order to engage users to continue using the product over several months, gamification elements will be implemented into the mobile app. By expanding on the machine-model through a longitudinal study, earlier detection of asthma exacerbations may be identified. Early detection leads to improved self-management as measured by the reduction of severe asthma attacks, the use of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalizations, emergency department or urgent care visits related to asthma.

    The proposed project aims to develop an asthma management tool that provides parents a simple way to reliably monitor their child's lung health, eliminating the guesswork associated with relying on symptoms alone. The rate of asthma continues to rise, with an increasing amount of healthcare utilization among asthmatic individuals. Effective technologies for proper management remain trapped within the hospital due to high costs and requirement of a skilled lab technician for proper measurement collection. This proposal aims to develop an algorithm alongside UCSF pediatric pulmonologists to gain consistent and accurate spirometry measurements, so that only proper measurements are acted upon. Our machine-learning algorithm will determine the cause of failure and prompt the user on corrective action to achieve a good quality measurement on a subsequent effort. By the end of this proposal period, the applicant will have a mobile app algorithm that is able to achieve the consistency of a trained lab technician, provide effective corrective feedback, engage users over the span of months for consistent lung monitoring, and potentially predict the onset of an asthma attack.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project was initiated as a direct result of extensive
    research into the US math crisis and the complexity of the problem. As a nation,
    we must invest resources directly into the breaking point: the mid school math
    cliff. The US shows the greatest decline worldwide from 4th to 10th grade on International
    tests in math. This project is designed to address all 146 Common Core State Standards
    (and all other state math standards) from 5th to 8th grade, providing a virtual
    reality context for each standard, embedded in an engaging, interactive 3-Act
    math story problem. The theoretical foundation of the project stems from Productive
    Failure, the concept that students perform better when they encounter productive
    failure prior to direct instruction in contrast to the reverse, where instruction
    is given first. Additionally, each simulator directly links student input to functional
    output to show how the math works, specifically allowing students to persist in
    exploring solutions. This project supports the NSF mission to support education
    for all fields fundamental to science and engineering, and holds the potential
    to positively impact a critical problem in U.S. education through broad commercial
    acceptance in schools throughout the US. \n\nThis project is designed to provide
    simulations in a virtual reality context for all standards from 5th to 8th grade,
    using a core software platform for delivery that can be ubiquitously used in classrooms
    throughout the United States. This high-risk technical innovation uniquely embeds
    math content in such a way that input leads to functional output such that students
    can see how the math actually works. Students watch the outcomes of their solutions,
    both the successes and the failures so they can try again. Math problems have
    context and meaning. Students experience the direct results of their mathematical
    abilities, while teachers have the ability to deploy specific problems and receive
    real-time metrics to further respond and support student comprehension. Underlying
    the advanced classroom technology is the pedagogical framework based on Productive
    Failure and the intentional withholding of instruction and information prior to
    direct experience with grappling with a difficult problem with trial and error
    repetition. The goal of the research is to illustrate that math simulations show
    the highest achievement in comparison to other methodologies and that Productive
    Failure is a viable tenant of learning that can be applied to all fields supporting
    higher math applications and scientific discovery."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, intraoperative imaging
    technology to address the problem of inadvertent cuts to vasculature during minimally
    invasive surgeries. More than 17% of patients who undergo these types of in-patient
    surgeries suffer from an intraoperative bleeding event. When a vessel is injured,
    there is a higher probability of hospital borne infection due to the loss of blood,
    and the added cost of care per patient increases by thousands of dollars due to
    corrective action and extended length of stay for the patient. The risk of vascular
    injury is compounded by risk factors, such as obesity, which limit the surgeon's
    ability to visualize and navigate vasculature. Therefore, there is a critical
    need to identify and assess hidden vasculature in real time. The proposed technology
    helps identify blood vessel before a cut is made. Importantly, this system will
    be designed for seamless integration into a suite of surgical instruments for
    multiple applications. Long term, the company will provide surgeons with the preeminent
    imaging platform to view, assess, and characterize a range of vessels (i.e. arteries/veins,

    \n\nThe proposed project will develop a novel blood vessel detection and visualization

    This system will be simple, cost-effective, easy to employ, and highly accurate.
    Traditionally, the avoidance of blood vessels during minimally invasive surgery
    is accomplished by visualization or costly intraoperative imaging. The proposed
    technology will use pulsatile light absorption characteristics of blood vessels
    to provide quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time,
    supplementing a surgeon's technique. This project will also add significant value
    to the body of research conducted in the areas of signal processing and image
    analysis. In addition, the proposed technology will remove the risk of data loss
    due to artifacts in general and motion artifacts in particular. The proposed technology

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the objective of demonstrating that discrete, belt mounted internet-connected wearable devices used by industrial workers can detect high risk lifting activities, promote safe lifting practices and behavior change, and predict the risk of musculoskeletal injuries due to unsafe lifting. Each year over 600,000 workers suffer a musculoskeletal injury due to lifting related activities, which cost US companies over $15bn annually. Worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company and are a unnecessary cause of human suffering. By developing a wearable device that can detect high risk lifting activity and provide immediate feedback to workers, safer lifting practices can be promoted and a reduction in the number of unsafe lifts registered, leading to a reduction in injuries.

    The project includes three main technical objectives: i) the development of machine learning algorithms to detect lifting events from sensor data, and to measure risk related metrics associated to those lifting events. When a lift is considered high risk, real-time feedback will be provided to the worker; ii) the deployment of the device in an industrial setting at several customer sites for 12 months, with the number of high risk lifts performed by workers quantified over time to measure the ability of the system to drive behavior change in the workforce; and ii) the development of a model that can predict the likelihood of musculoskeletal injures based on the risk metrics measured. It is expected that the outcomes of the project demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of suffering musculoskeletal injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment value proposition for the industrial companies and their insurance carriers who are potential customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality of care for anterior ocular wounds. To accomplish this, the project is focused on the development of a novel, hand-held, point-of-care device that can be used to evaluate the ocular surface in post-trauma or post-surgical patients. The device should be able to provide an accurate, objective measurement of a tear film biomarker that can be used by medical professionals to identify dangerous fluid leaks in the front of the eye which can save vision. Currently, this evaluation is only performed by trained eye doctors and requires positioning the patient at an expensive, immobile machine called a slit lamp to evaluate their eye. This cannot be done on patients who are unconscious or uncooperative and availability of this machine is limited. The lack of adequate tools for evaluation results in limited access to care, costly hospital transfers and missed diagnosis of wound leaks which can cause severe ocular infections and permanent vision loss. Successful commercialization of this product is expected to improve the accuracy of ocular examinations in 3.8 million Americans annually and may introduce a new frontier of tear film testing.


    The proposed project is focused on developing the device for direct use for patient care. The technological aim of the research is on the creation of a sophisticated biosensor that can accurately and noninvasively evaluate the tear film concentration of a specific biomarker. This work is expected to include the development of the electrical circuitry, the chemical composition and the channels for connection to the base unit. The plan is to also design the model for the handheld device. In order to make the device safe for patient use, the device can then be tested for its shelf-life stability and develop the proper sterilization. The next steps of testing can include clinical patients to evaluate the ability of the device to record the findings from the tear film. This information can then be used to refine the exact testing parameters for the device. The anticipated result of this research is a final prototype of the device that can be used for regulatory approval and clinical trials. The goal of the project is to transform the current standard of care for eye professionals and enable physicians to have an objective measure that can warn them about possible wound leaks and potentially save vision.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the result of introducing a new generation of low-power wireless sensors for detecting Acoustic Emission events and detecting fatigue damage in structures. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the US transportation infrastructure has 605,102 operational bridges, of which 66,561 are structurally deficient. In particular, the fatigue damage monitoring technology of the project will initially target the more than 18,000 US highway bridges that are categorized as ?fracture critical? by the Federal Highway Administration. The technique?s ultra-low energy consumption will enable its use in low-power wireless sensors and make it an ideal response to this challenging problem. The anticipated benefits and commercial applications of this project are (1) a low-cost, easy-to-use mechanism for effective monitoring, allowing for early detection and timely repair of fracture and fatigue damage in infrastructure systems such as highway bridges; (2) improved public safety, with reduced maintenance costs and extension of the service life of critical and high-valued infrastructure systems; and (3) additional commercial applications in monitoring the structural health and integrity of other structures, including aircraft, oil and gas pipelines, machinery, cargo cranes, ships, etc.

    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses distributed structural health monitoring (SHM) of infrastructure systems, particularly highway bridges. Because the creation of fatigue cracks in a structure is accompanied by the propagation of acoustic emission (AE) waves, wireless AE sensors can be used to detect such cracks. However, a challenge of AE detection sensors is high energy consumption, significantly more than the energy available in a battery-operated wireless device. As a result, conventional AE detection methods cannot be used with low-power wireless sensors. This project uses a novel and ultra-low power technique for long term monitoring of strain.  Then, AE monitoring is activated only if history of tensile strain in the structure under monitoring suggests likelihood of fatigue damage. In addition, using history and pattern of AE events, the method estimates the severity of fatigue damage in a material. Moreover, the method uses a variety of techniques to eliminate the effects of mechanical noise on AE measurements and achieve a high reliability in fatigue damage assessment. After development, the method is planned to be evaluated on highway bridges, airframes, and pipelines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is very significant. Suboptimal operational decision-making in emergency departments and hospitals leads to inefficiencies that result in excessive patient wait-times, the diversion of ambulances to other emergency departments, wasted resources and patients who either leave before being treated or against medical advice. By connecting modern analytical approaches, including statistical modeling and systems engineering methods, to real-time data routinely collected by hospitals, the proposed project promises to result in a tremendously valuable analytics platform that will assist administrators in making dozens of operational and staffing decisions each day. This informed decision-making will not only improve hospital efficiency, it will lead to both healthier and more satisfied patients and simultaneous dramatic increases in revenue and profit. The technology proposed will have the potential to add significant value to the approximately 5,000 hospitals in the U.S., often on the order of millions of dollars annually. Hospitals and health systems now realize the value of effective analytics, and the analytics platform proposed here will be an obvious investment for any emergency department or hospital whose goal is to provide the best care to its patients at lower costs.

    The proposed project promises to yield a set of decision-support applications upon which emergency departments and hospitals will base their decisions each day. Substantial investments by hospitals and health systems on information technology, and in particular, electronic health records, have set the stage for evidence-based, data-driven decisions. These decisions will effectively leverage real-time data along with analytical methods such as statistical forecasting and event-simulation modeling. In particular, this proposed project will develop software applications, based on these analytical methods and linking to real-time data sources, tailored to emergency departments and hospitals. This project will involve 1) addressing the real-time needs of hospital operational decision-makers, 2) further developing a statistical and simulation modeling platform to inform these real-time needs, specifically reflecting emergency departments and whole hospitals, and 3) ultimately ensuring that actionable insights are delivered in a timely and intuitive manner to key stakeholders. These actionable insights that derive from the data and sophisticated methods must be delivered to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, but will then have the capacity to substantially improve both the quality and efficiency of care-delivery throughout the hospital.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create a suite of consumer hardware and software products that provide realistic tactile feedback to users who are touching objects in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). As evidenced by the current proliferation of low-cost head-mounted displays and motion tracking systems, three-dimensional interaction technologies are revolutionizing how people interact with computers, media, and each other. Since they are currently limited to vision and audio, endowing consumer-level human-computer interfaces with high-fidelity tactile feedback will vastly increase user immersion, making games more fun, online interactions more effective, and tools more efficient. Consequently, this project has the potential to expand the commercial reach of the burgeoning VR/AR market, opening up myriad opportunities for companies particularly in the gaming, entertainment, and e-commerce sectors. The innovation of this project also promises to enhance scientific and technological understanding of haptic human-computer interaction by establishing a new paradigm that blends minimal wearable hardware with sophisticated software algorithms. Finally, commercializing novel interactive technology also has the potential to help inspire a diverse array of young people to pursue a career in the critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and math.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to advance knowledge of low-cost technology that can provide realistic tactile feedback to a user touching objects in VR or AR: the project?s intellectual merits center on testing a new approach that combines minimal haptic hardware and sophisticated software algorithms. The research objective is to create a fully functional industrial prototype of a wearable fingertip thimble and custom software that embody the proposed approach. When the user's finger moves to touch a virtual object, a platform inside the thimble will initiate contact with the fingerpad and press with a force that varies with penetration distance, to render surface softness. A thermal actuator will convey the object?s thermal conductivity and temperature. When the finger slides along a virtual object, the user will feel its texture via carefully designed platform vibrations. Specific research tasks to be addressed include exploring haptic actuator options, building a library of haptic object properties (HOPs) that can be applied to virtual objects, and creating a communication protocol for exchanging haptic signals among devices. This project is expected to yield a fully functional industrial prototype and developer kits for the wearable fingertip thimble.

    the advancement of telerobotic control technology for subsea operations. As humans
    deploy and maintain ever more complex underwater hardware, conduct subsea scientific
    sampling and exploration and develop natural resources in hostile, deep and remote
    locations, the need for ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is increasing. ROVs
    have transitioned from basic transport and inspection tools to mission critical
    machines for construction, maintenance and intervention. Despite advances in sensing
    and machinery, significant challenges persist which have plagued the industry
    with high costs and unacceptable downtime, as well as safety risks. Limited situational
    awareness, data deluge and inadequate manual operator controls combine to create
    high rates of equipment breakage, unpredictable and inefficient task completion
    and high mission overhead. This work is developing innovative products for 3-dimensional
    visual awareness and computer assisted control systems for subsea teleoperated
    robots. Divers can be replaced in hazardous situations by telerobots using this
    technology. The rate of untoward incidents and their severity will be reduced
    for a large range of subsea activities. Economic benefits include reduced costs,
    new employment opportunities, competitive advantages and contributions to the
    national technological infrastructure in subsea operations. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address fundamental challenges
    of connecting higher-dimensional data from remote environments to intuitive controls.
    Its intellectual merit is the refinement of a collaborative approach to command
    and control allowing ROV pilots to communicate seamlessly with each other and
    the robotic system. This will be done by developing several foundational innovations
    that, separately, enhance capabilities (and may become individual products), and
    that together derive immense value to the customer. These technologies are in
    the areas of: (1) Pilot Interface/Control room software; (2) Sensor fusion and
    processing; (3) Task assistance and workflow management; and (4) Manipulator and
    vehicle control. Successful implementation of visualization, sensor fusion, control
    methods, and haptic virtual fixtures serves as an excellent demonstration example
    of these technologies. With these technologies combined into a single software
    platform and integrated with a robotic system, increased performance, predictability,
    and safety can be achieved in a way that surpasses what is currently possible
    for purely automated or manual robotic systems. Although this work is focused
    on underwater operations, it can also be extended to terrestrial applications,
    such as industrial assembly, welding and machining, nuclear maintenance and robotic
    dredging and excavation."

    that up to 95% of the waste stream could be recycled, only a third of the 250
    million tons of municipal solid waste that are generated each year in the United
    States is currently diverted. Greater diversion would provide immense savings
    in landfill and processing costs, and benefit the environment as well. Tens of
    millions of pounds of greenhouse gas emissions from virgin material mining may
    be eliminated, and pollution from landfill waste reduced. The existing sorting

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to create a medical device capable of rapidly guiding treatment to stop bleeding in trauma patients. Trauma can affect the body's ability to form clots to stop bleeding. Of the more than 2 million severe cases of trauma in the U.S., approximately one third will develop a condition: trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which increases mortality 4-fold. TIC can be corrected; however, current tests to identify TIC take too long to effectively guide treatment. This leads to sub-optimal care and increased mortality and morbidity. The current standard-of-care to correct TIC is the transfusion of blood products. A patient should only be transfused if necessary because unnecessary transfusions can lead to complications resulting in longer hospital stays and even death. A rapid assay that can evaluate a trauma patient's coagulation status can help guide treatment of their injuries, resulting in improved standard-of-care that can both save lives and healthcare dollars. Yearly trauma rates unfortunately remain stable, and with an addressable market of more than $400M per year in the U.S., the commercial impact for such an assay is significant.

    The proposed project is to develop a rapid assay that provides an individualized assessment of a trauma patient's coagulation status. A significant subset of trauma patients develop impairment to the normal coagulation process as a result of their injuries. Current assays to identify this impairment take too long to effectively guide treatment. Therefore, successful completion of this project will yield a disposable microfluidic card (microcard) that has multiple advantages over current assays, which are slow and non-specific. The microcard will measure clot characteristics currently used by emergency room physicians to guide treatment, but will do so in less than five minutes. This is a critical feature as it quickly guides treatment, meaning that there is time for re-evaluation to determine if treatment is effective. The microcard will also include on-board positive and negative controls that indicate a patient?s individual coagulation profile. This will result in personalized and more accurate treatments that can reduce complications and mortality. The rapid and specific microcard assay will significantly improve care of injured patients while conserving resources and time, ultimately saving money for the U.S. healthcare system.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in promoting the protection of human health, the environment, and our nation's natural resources by providing new sensors that enable fast, accurate, cost-effective sampling and analysis tools to monitor pollution and exposure. The innovations developed here will allow for the rapid identification and detection of hazardous compounds in water at substantially reduced cost. These technological innovations will translate into triple bottom-line savings of companies by enhancing our ability to protect people and the planet, while simultaneously providing cost and time savings to the business. The technology embodies the concepts of sustainability and ease of use, and will achieve broad commercial appeal by saving businesses money, time, and effort while also giving them more data on potential sources of pollution. Scientifically, this technology will enable more precise assessment of environmental pollution by providing more rapid measurement capability at a larger scale than is currently possible.


    This project will develop an innovative, market-disruptive technology for measuring toxic metals in water. This technology is inexpensive, portable, and does not require any power or external reading equipment. Furthermore, it can be adapted to a wide range of toxic compounds after initial commercialization around metals analysis. The system costs an order of magnitude less than the current "point of need" technologies capable of quantitative determination of toxic metals in water, and two orders of magnitude less than the traditional laboratory tests. Access Sensor Technologies is a new startup, but the core team has a strong track record in the field of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for environmental analysis where the proposed system represents a major innovation in the field. The proposal has four technical objectives: (1) Expand the palette of applicable chemistry to include additional metals: cadmium, lead, manganese, and both chromium 3+ and 6+; (2) Test the prototype system in a relevant laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment; (3) Achieve a successful customer-driven demonstration of the system in the field; and (4) Identify key elements of manufacturability that define the roadmap to production of the system at market scale.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a system to dramatically simplify how course content is shared, discovered, curated and managed in educational institutions. The vast majority of content in educational institutions is in multiple silo-ed repositories. Hence, compliance tracking, aligning curricula with competencies and course authoring are manual and expensive processes. This project aims to unlock these silos and make it simple to search, tag and curate courseware at topic-level across multiple platforms. The technology also extracts student feedback and assessment information and maps it against granular learning objectives to provide new insights to track and improve learning outcomes. By unlocking courseware stuck in silo-ed college systems, this project facilitates a cross-institutional marketplace that enables any institution to share and/or monetize curated high quality content, and conversely have access to curated course packs that may be taught by adjunct faculty, a $2B market opportunity. Simplifying faculty access to Open Educational Resources and curated learning content from other colleges will help drive down student course-pack costs significantly.

    The key technical innovation in this project is seamless extraction of learning content from multiple educational repositories coupled with a syllabus-driven semantically intelligent search and recommendation engine woven into the course curation process. Developing an abstracted mechanism to interface with different types of learning management systems and other repositories, and making it portable without requiring a common content format is a significant innovation. Natural Language Processing techniques combined with curated controlled vocabularies and taxonomies are applied to simplify curation of a course, notably automatic topic identification and instructional tagging. The curation data is leveraged in the semantic search engine to improve recommendation of courseware during course authoring. The goal of the adaptive recommendation engine is to improve discovery and usage of both open educational resources and courseware developed in other colleges, without requiring expensive professional services. Another goal of the project is to extract student feedback seamlessly using IMS defined standards regardless of which learning management system is used to deliver the content. The student feedback, assessment data, grades and other information pulled from various college systems are then correlated to provide rich analytics and visibility of student outcomes and alignment of courseware with competencies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to make the 'green' solar industry truly green. As the deployment of solar modules expands rapidly, so will module wastes. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that module wastes will appear in large quantities by early 2030's and by 2050 they will total 78 million tonnes. Today most module wastes end up in landfills. This SBIR project will develop a technology to maximize the revenue from module recycling. It has the potential to enable a profitable recycling business without any government subsidy. By recovering all the valuable components in modules, our technology has the potential to generate up to $60 billion in revenue from 78 million tonnes of modules.

    The proposed project develops sustainable recycling processes and related equipment for silicon solar cells and modules. The goal of the project is to separate and recover all the valuable, toxic, and bulky components in cells and modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, lead, copper, aluminum, tin, and glass. The target for solar-grade silicon recovery is 85% and the target for metal recovery, especially silver, is over 90%. The revenue from recycling, based on today's prices for solar-grade silicon and silver, is $15/module by our technology, as compared to $3.50/module by today's technology. The primary work of this project will be developing a prototype for silicon solar cell recycling and optimizing the process for a production environment. The target throughput of the prototype is up to 50 kg of solar cell wastes per day.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This project proposes to develop an innovative approach to improve and sustain math educators' problem solving teaching skills. Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor.

    This effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom.

- abstractText: "This project creates an educational, touchscreen-based software that
    translates visual educational content into accessible, multisensory content for
    students with special needs, and particularly those with blindness and visual
    impairments. Consider the challenge in the educational landscape today: schools
    are increasingly adopting digital tools oriented toward creating a more interactive,
    personalized experience for mainstream students, but at the same time, are struggling
    to accommodate their diverse student population, particularly, the 6 million students
    in special education in the U.S. This problem is exaggerated in Science, Technology,
    Engineering, and Math (STEM), where content is often complex and visual. This
    project addresses these challenges, building on what we already know about human
    information processing and haptic interfaces to create software that will automatically
    convert highly visual content into content that can be seen, heard, and felt in
    real-time in class. This project supports NSF?s mission ensuring that inclusion
    of all students is at the forefront of the digital transformation of U.S. classrooms.
    The societal impacts of this work overcome several barriers impeding students
    with special needs from being independent and active contributors in the STEM
    educational experience and ultimately, many STEM professions. ViTAL projects a
    direct, financial return on investment for taxpayers within three years of operations,
    generating both revenue and new jobs, with plans to multiply this growth year
    over year. \n\n\nThe innovation in this project is the creation of methods and
    algorithms for effective translation of visual content into multimodal content,
    appropriately down sampled for the nonvisual sensory channels yet effective in
    conveying the most meaningful information. Such a conversion currently does not
    exist, which results in high overhead costs to create accessible graphics and
    is a major pain point in special education, particularly for individuals with
    visual impairments or blindness. Further, translating graphical content from the
    visual to the multimodal (visual, auditory, and haptic) space is not a straightforward
    conversion due to the limited bandwidth of human touch compared to vision and
    the complexity of features presented in graphical information. This challenge
    is exaggerated when accounting for the varying types of haptic feedback that can
    be provided from varying platforms (Android and iOS). This project addresses these
    challenges, creating a streamlined solution for generating accessible, multisensory
    content, in real-time, on commercial platforms for K-12 classrooms. The outcomes
    of this project will (1) create the algorithms needed to provide an automated
    conversion from the visual to multimodal space, (2) establish a teacher \"dashboard\"
    to streamline the proposed software?s integration in the classroom, and (3) expand
    the software to the iOS market while simultaneously uncovering novel haptic effects
    that leverage Apple?s unique Taptic feedback. Upon completion of the development,
    the software will be beta tested with partnering schools, and then released on
    both Android and iOS markets."

    This project, from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), extends its I-Corps Site. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. The Penn I-Corps Site supports the translation of research from STEM areas into the marketplace by providing educational programming, financial support, and strategic guidance through offering Site e-teams access to commercialization programs at its innovation hub, the Penn Center for Innovation (PCI). The Site employs a structured process for business model validation following the Lean Launchpad methodology. Within the context of technologies arising from STEM research at Penn, the goals of the Site are to train teams consisting of faculty, staff, and students by providing hands-on experiential entrepreneurial education, and to accelerate startup creation at Penn.

    A direct result of the Penn I-Corps Site is hands-on training in the Customer Discover Methodology of faculty and students, applications to the NSF's I-Corp program, validation of market need for team projects, the creation of new startups and, when appropriate, licensing of technologies originating from Penn research. The ultimate goal is to help transition of research to commercialization. Promoting a hands-on experiential approach the Site's activities integrate education and traditional technology transfer. More than 75 teams have already been trained since the Penn Site started operating in the summer of 2015. From these, 32 companies were launched, which have acquired $7.2 million in funding via grant awards and investments, and 39 jobs created.

    This project, from The National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance, Inc. (VentureWell), coordinates, convenes, and evaluates the National Innovation Network and its Innovation Corps (I-Corps) programs.

    Through this project, VentureWell connects national programs to form the "National Innovation Network" (NIN). This emerging community of innovators represents a key component of NSF's I-Corps programs. With the NIN, NSF accelerates the development of a national innovation ecosystem that reaches deeply and broadly across the country to engage the most creative and consequential research discoveries and talents in the process of entrepreneurship. The NIN is composed of clusters of universities that support the I-Corps  Nodes -- the primary training group for the I-Corps national course teams; the I-Corps Sites -- that include the individual institutions dedicated to spurring on very early stage teams; the Teams -- that focus on market validation of technology innovations; and organizational stakeholders such as mentors who support the teams, and venture development partners such as angel investors, venture capitalists and other types of investors.

    The role of VentureWell in the advancing of the NIN involves seven primary activities:
         1. Commission teaching teams for eleven NSF I-Corps National Team Trainings
         2. Implement I-Corps Faculty Training
         3. Convene an I-Corps Faculty Summit
         4. Design and implement Teaching Assistant Training
         5. Organize and implement the annual National Innovation Network conference that brings together all of the Nodes and Sites
         6. Prepare, disseminate and archive the curriculum and curate best practices for pedagogical improvements
         7. Conduct Ongoing Course Evaluation

    A particular focus of this project is VentureWell's research and assessment of formative and summative evaluation of I-Corps Team experiences in cohorts as well as related dissemination activity. The formative evaluation is designed to understand participants' satisfaction with the cohort and course and perspective on the course environment, to understand the quality of instruction, and to assess knowledge gains. The evaluation involves the administration, response rate monitoring, data collection, and cleaning of four surveys: (i) pre-course, (ii) after kickoff, (iii) after week-3 of course weekly webinars, and (iv) post-course. The summative evaluation is designed to track individual and team outcomes of interest to NSF and assess the impact of the course at approximately one year and 3.5 years after formal participation in the program ends. Finally, dissemination activities are designed to ensure that key program information is shared with appropriate audiences. In addition, VentureWell is creating public-use datasets. These datasets contain de-identified data from the pre-course, post-course and longitudinal outcomes surveys in order to disseminate information about the program to the I-Corps research community and allow others to use these data in their research.

    Site for an additional three years beyond their initial three-year award. NSF
    Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities
    whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their
    technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice,
    resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups
    to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.
    I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute
    to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
    investors. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are
    submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site.
    These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals
    are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site.
    These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years. \n\nThe
    intellectual merits of the I-Corps Site renewal project at UCF include the capture
    and curation of a deep understanding of (1) the processes, methodologies and programs
    for entrepreneurship education and technology commercialization, (2) Best practices
    for transitioning research from the bench top into the marketplace, (3) and distributing
    this knowledge to collaborators, partners, and affiliates throughout the NIN,
    and (4) development and adaptation of programs for specialty cohorts supporting
    local clusters and targeted populations. Additional knowledge and understanding
    will be gained through the collection of longitudinal data following I-Corps participants
    after they have completed the curriculum. \n\nUCF is an active and engaged partner
    in the Central Florida innovation ecosystem. The broader impacts from this project
    directly contribute to the broader community understanding of innovation-based
    economic development and the importance of research and commercialization. This
    is critically important to a community that is dependent on tourism and hospitality
    and the associated lower paying jobs in the region. Building on the initial successes
    of the UCF I-Corps Site program, successful commercialization of research and
    inventions generated at the leading research institutions and affiliate organizations
    in the region, this renewal project has the potential to significantly impact
    the regional economy. Further, with curriculum that effectively serves Hispanic
    populations, there is the potential to produce major social and economic impact
    on a national level. Florida has the third largest Hispanic population in the
    U.S., with nearly 25% of UCF student population and 34% of Florida business owners
    being of Hispanic origin, making this an ideal location to develop, deploy, and
    refine the curriculum."

    This project, from Binghamton University, creates an NSF I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The Binghamton I-Corps Site strengthens the ecosystem at Binghamton University. By integrating existing innovation support programs and technology transfer with entrepreneurship and business incubation services, technologies stemming from faculty research, student ingenuity, and community innovators are evaluated for commercial viability. Experienced technology transfer professionals, technical experts resident in Binghamton's industry-facing centers, and on-staff entrepreneurship and financial advisers recruit teams and promote promising teams into the program.

    Entrepreneurship and engineering faculty, entrepreneurs-in-residence (EIRs), and community coaches and mentors stimulate ideation and team building, and guide the innovators through theory and practice, and, ultimately, the go / no-go decision. By virtue of a rigorous selection process and hands-on training, the teams with customer-validated, technology- and manufacturing-feasible products and services proceed with commercialization with further support from the university, local businesses, and funders, as well as the I-Corps regional and national nodes. The process creates a growing cadre of entrepreneurs who continue to innovate, build businesses, mentor and invest in others, and overall recharge the entrepreneurial ecosystem, making Binghamton and the University a hub for entrepreneurs, investors, and start-up companies.

    The Binghamton I-Corps Site is meant to transform the mindset of University faculty, staff and students, as well as that of community members and leaders by providing a practical, achievable approach to generating new, sustainable ventures built around technologies. Demonstrating this path forward creates positive and powerful relationships between universities, the local business, professional services and investor communities, industry, and government. Generating trust and interactions between academia-private sector-government has ripple effects far beyond the teams going through the program, and propagate a self-sustaining, entrepreneurial ecosystem driven and replenished by new launches. Furthermore, by bringing together entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs, this Site program blurs lines separating big and small business, manufacturing and service industries, academia and the private sector, and spurs efforts towards the common goal of value and job creation through new ventures. Successful launches of companies inspire Binghamton University researchers, students and graduates, and instill optimism about the prospects for creating wealth and fulfilling jobs in Binghamton, or wherever their careers take them throughout the nation.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The Penn State I-Corps Site, operated under the umbrella of the Invent Penn State Initiative and the Office of Entrepreneurship and Commercialization, supports the translation of university research, develops partnerships between the university and regional economic development organizations and the national I-Corps Network, and trains students to be the drivers of research commercialization.

    The Penn State I-Corps Site teams that pursue commercialization through two different programs, the TechCelerator@State College and the Happy Valley LaunchBox. These two programs are structured to nurture innovator teams using Lean Startup methodology and embody the notion of nurturing innovators both with deep craft and fresh eyes, that is, people with some who have depth of technical expertise as well as those with a fresh perspective on new markets, communication technologies, and consumer concepts. The TechCelerator Program, established in 2011 seeks to accelerate the commercialization of University technology. The Happy Valley Launchbox, created in 2015, is a community-university accelerator that makes extensive use of Lean Startup principles and Design Thinking to help teams bring their ideas into the marketplace. The I-Corps Site program provides funds to teams that are either selected out of one of these programs or have members combined from both programs to support the translation of university technology. The I-Corps Site also engages the broad network of Penn State Innovation hubs across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

    The outcomes of this project have the potential for significant broader impacts across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the region. Initial activity focuses on Penn State's main University Park Campus. However, Invent Penn State operates 13 community innovation hubs throughout the State, affiliated with the University's network of Commonwealth campuses. In addition, the Penn State I-Corps Site, in collaboration with the Upstate New York regional I-Corps Node will run summer programs to train leaders from the commonwealth innovation hubs in Lean startup methodology and will engage their promising teams with the Upstate New York (UNY) regional I-Corps Node.

    This project, from Vanderbilt University, creates an NSF I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    Vanderbilt University is investing in building an innovation ecosystem in the Middle Tennessee region. The institution plays a significant role in providing pathways to commercialization for scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics related research and new startup endeavors. In 2016, Vanderbilt opened its Wond'ry, a new innovation center that serves its entire community of faculty, students, and staff across all academic disciplines. The Wond?ry provides a facility to host and implement the NSF I-Corps Sites program. Since its opening, the Wond'ry inspired innovation and entrepreneurial interest on campus. Combined with the I-Corps Site it becomes the primary pipeline to commercialization for many aspiring innovators and entrepreneurs. Implementing the I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt makes a positive difference by advancing on-campus activities related to scouting, recruiting, educating supporting and contributing to the National Innovation Network. The two primary outcomes of the I-Corps at Vanderbilt Program are growing a talented diverse and globally competitive workforce of STEM and Life Scientists that are trained to think entrepreneurially about discovery, and nuturing and supporting multiple, local teams to transition their new innovations and research into the marketplace.

    The I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt University goals are twofold: 1) to effectively integrate educational opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students on innovation and entrepreneurship within the traditional STEM and Life science curriculum, and 2) to motivate scientists to engage further in customer discovery as part of their scientific agenda, in the hopes that they will devote their science to addressing and solving problems and real needs in society. The Site at Vanderbilt helps overcome commercialization challenges by incorporating a for-credit course built heavily on the I-Corps curriculum and through the hosting of workshops that provide an introduction to customer discovery and business canvas development. By providing a proven model of success and more cohesive structure, the program ensures that faculty, staff, and students receive the best possible training and are introduced to a vast array of regional and national entrepreneurial resources.

    The I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt trains participants to 1) create solutions to problems with significant positive impact on communities, 2) focus on research with major economic development opportunities, and 3) develop into globally competitive as STEM entrepreneurs. Society will ultimately benefit via an improvement in quality of life through the solutions created to address real-world issues. Middle Tennessee will benefit by having a cohort of well-trained entrepreneurs who, by completing the I-Corps program, will better understand how to identify a viable commercial opportunity and subsequently oversee its successful operational implementation and launch. This will speed the translation of research into new technologies. The subsequent positive economic impacts will occur via these increases in commercialization activities and the number of useful intellectual property disclosures. Subsequent agreements with commercial partners will then grow the region's entrepreneurial ecosystem and empower STEM-entrepreneurs in larger numbers than ever before, thus increasing self confidence in undertaking entrepreneurial endeavors and thus contributing positively to our nation's overall economic growth and vibrancy.

    accelerate the commercialization of student, faculty and regional innovations
    into the marketplace, foster and facilitate the exchange of ideas between the
    university and industry and prepare students to become entrepreneurs. This I-Corps
    Sites project: \n1. Supports and expands an entrepreneurial culture in a region
    where entrepreneurs historically have not had significant assistance; \n2. Expands
    opportunities for undergraduate and graduate business and STEM students so that
    they are able obtain hands-on experience in the implementation of product validation
    activities and to engage in real-world STEM-related business projects; \n3. Assists
    STEM faculty to become more comfortable with the practice of marketing their inventions
    by introducing them to the I-Corps theory and practice of the I-Corps methodology;
    \n4. Integrates the I-Corps methodology throughout the UTRGV infrastructure so
    that the university will be able to carry out its mission of \"transforming Texas
    and the nation through the commercialization of university discoveries\".\n\nThere
    are several advantages to having an I-Corps site at UTRGV: being located directly
    on the U-S.-Mexican border, the UTRGV I-Corps is unique in that it the site is
    both binational and bicultural; and, the region that UTRGV serves is one of the
    fastest growing yet impoverished areas in the country. Promoting support for entrepreneurship
    in such a region demonstrates how well the I-Corps methodology works in a historically
    underserved area of the country.\n\nThis project advances the commercialization
    of ideas that come from the STEM colleges and departments within UTRGV by providing
    STEM faculty and students with a methodology to promote their products and ideas
    in the marketplace. It also broadens the participation of normally underrepresented
    Hispanic students in the commercialization process. Ultimately, it will benefit
    the regional economy of deep-south Texas by providing support for start-up businesses
    and it will enhance the research enterprise at UTRGV through the creation of interdisciplinary
    teams."

    This project, at the University of Arkansas (UA), creates an I-Corps Site at this institution that involves participants from three UA campuses.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The University of Arkansas I-Corps Site, STEP (STEAM Training in Entrepreneurial Practices), builds on university activities and programs that accelerate the commercialization of research by faculty and students. In addition, several UA Research Centers and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites will involve affiliated faculty and students in STEP, a 10-week summer program that is divided into two phases. Phase I, with 15 teams, will focus on instruction in lean startup principles and initial customer discovery interviews. Phase II, with eight teams that receive additional funding, will further develop the most promising business ideas from Phase I. The STEP site will include undergraduate and graduate student teams and faculty from three UA System campuses: the University of Arkansas (UA), the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), and the University of Arkansas Little Rock (UALR).

    Although the state of Arkansas has made progress in the development of high-growth businesses based on university research outcomes over the past decade, Arkansas continues to be one of the most economically challenged states in the country. The STEP Site encourages researchers to expand their horizons beyond the research they are doing in their labs and consider how the commercialization of their inventions might help promote economic development in the state. In addition to the broader impact of economic development, the STEP Site enables the university to continue its efforts to improve entrepreneurial education for females and underrepresented populations. The university's successful programs for underrepresented high school through graduate students provide a base upon which to build these efforts.

    researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. This is a Type II I-Corps Site involving
    the extension of funding for an existing I-Corps Site that was first funded in
    2013. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted
    by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals
    may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted
    by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals
    may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.\n\nThe Site extensions
    of the California State University (CSU) Program for Education and Research in
    Biotechnology (CSUPERB) for an additional three years builds on experience as
    an I-Corps Site and grows institutional support for life sciences entrepreneurship
    education and technology transfer. The activities involved in this renewal aim
    to smooth the development path for nascent academic entrepreneurs across the CSU.
    Specifically during Phase II, CSU I-Corps is: recruiting biological sciences researchers
    and funding 30 Site Teams annually, providing opportunities to discover biotechnology
    commercialization pathways; building on CSU I-Corps' growing community of life
    science entrepreneurs, alumni, industry experts and campus-based entrepreneurship
    resources to offer tailored advice for research-based ventures; and developing
    a three-part program for nascent biological sciences entrepreneurs to help them
    escape social and cognitive biases, explore venture ideas, assess technologies
    to solve problems, and discover commercialization pathways. The I-Corps Biological
    Sciences Site nurtures CSU researchers so that they gain confidence in their entrepreneurial
    abilities, greater understanding of biotechnology commercialization pathways,
    and a better calibration of their concepts maturity level. \n\nMore than a quarter
    of the CSU STEM baccalaureates are from underrepresented populations - CSU educates
    more Hispanic, African-American, and American Indian undergraduates than all other
    institutions in the state combined. The CSU diverse student population is engaged
    in immersive learning provided by biological sciences research and entrepreneurial
    activities. Employers and investors value creative students who graduate with
    demonstrated accomplishments in team-based research, the ability to solve real-world
    problems, and experience with the unique challenges of biotechnology commercialization.
    CSU I-Corps gives students and faculty access to mentors, sources of capital,
    business expertise, and leadership opportunities."

    innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network
    of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe objective of USC's
    I-Corps Site is to establish a sustainable innovation ecosystem with strong links
    to the local entrepreneurial community. This Site nurtures science, technology,
    engineering and mathematics (STEM) faculty and students who are engaged in projects
    with potential to be transitioned into the marketplace using an integrated entrepreneurship
    curricula, business mentorship, and assignment of resources to early stage discoveries.
    \n\nThe USC I-Corps Site increases awareness and piques the interest of students
    and faculty in technology, expands the engagement of seasoned entrepreneurs and
    investors with researchers, and advances the translation of discoveries to commercial
    applications. The program encompasses three major tasks: (1) enhances entrepreneurial
    training based on the Lean LaunchPad methodology, (2) expands USC's current engagement
    with seasoned entrepreneurs and investors to foster mentoring of junior entrepreneurs.
    This is accomplished through a three-tier strategy that entails one-on-one mentoring,
    an Expert-in-Residence program, student internships in start-ups, and (3) fosters
    outreach activities by disseminating the program curricular activities and best
    practices, and directing strategies to enhance participation of underrepresented
    groups. \n\nThe USC Site program addresses critical barriers to the growth of
    academic entrepreneurship by providing an experiential learning framework with
    an emphasis on customer discovery, networking, and strategic partnerships. The
    tangible outcomes include new opportunities for research funding, strengthened
    academia-industrial connections, and unique exposure of students to real world
    translational research. A secondary outcome of this program is the evolution of
    academic culture that values entrepreneurship and is more proactive in taking
    risk and finding resources to bring ideas to reality. This transition in academic
    culture enhances USC?s efforts to attract students in STEM fields and strengthens
    its role in economic development and job creation.\n\nThe outreach portion of
    this Site is geared toward improving diversity inclusion and enhancing participation
    of underrepresented groups through a wider dissemination of educational activities.
    The broader impacts are four-fold. First, the educational framework offers an
    immersive experience that prepares students to identify and pursue high impact
    opportunities regardless of their vocation. Second, it fosters the innovation
    ecosystem by promoting collaborations between faculty and business partners. This
    stimulates the commercial translation of fundamental research, and exposes the
    local business community to USC's research capacity. Third, it puts in place a
    robust framework for I-Corps team formation to enhance the chance of success of
    USC entrepreneurs in competing for SBIR/STTR and follow-on funding. Fourth, the
    program facilitates the development of a unique model for an entrepreneurial ecosystem
    that combines the best practices from Silicon Valley with the distinct resources
    and assets available in the Southeast."

    This project, from the University at Buffalo (IB), creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    Through their I-Corps Site, UB improves the way technology is commercialized and entrepreneurship is cultivated. UB receives over eighty invention disclosures annually that result in patents, licenses, and the formation of startup companies. To train participant entrepreneurial teams, UB's Business & Entrepreneur Partnerships in the Office of Economic Development (BEP) offers a unique two-phase, resource-efficient training process in the areas of: Customer Discovery, Lean Startup methods, The Business Model Canvas, Developing a prioritized list of testable hypotheses and open questions, and Assessing the strength of an opportunity. Under Phase I, teams receive workshop instruction, work closely with mentors and practice customer discovery. Phase II training integrates intensive customer engagement. UB views the NSF I-Corps Site program as an important way to: 1) perform more robust technical and commercial assessments of new technologies; 2) increase inventors' entrepreneurial skills leading to system-wide culture change; 3) improve the quality of future research proposals; 4) increase commercialization success; 5) prepare inventors and students for success in the I-Corps Node program; 6) pursue SBIR/STTR funding; and 6) provide graduate students and postdocs with a world class experience that will impact their entire careers.

    The UB I-Corps Site program broader impacts are realized through the creation of a network of strategic partnerships between researchers and engaged commercial interests. These relationships increase: industry-sponsored research funding; competitive SBIR/STTR applications; pivotal student experiences; campus-wide, interdisciplinary collaborations; the level of industry mentorship; the number and quality of invention disclosures; participation of 5-10 teams (annually) in the I-Corps Node Program; and overall culture change (innovative, entrepreneurial, collaborative, multidisciplinary). UB's Technology Transfer Office is joined by a number of other units and strategic partners - an inclusivity that extends the impact of the I-Corps Site award across the campus, into the business community, and supports a greater public mission.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This is a Type II proposal, requesting a "renewal" of funding for an existing I-Corps Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.

    The University of Utah I-Corps Site program encourages and assists students and faculty in transitioning research projects to commercialization by providing education, training, resources and networking required for understanding markets, customers, product-market fit and to answer business and/or technology questions. The I-Corps Site program at the University of Utah is currently in its 3rd year and has trained nearly 90 teams and over 150 participants. The program resulted in successful business and technology go/no-go decisions, successful transition to commercialization, and helped advance five technologies to the commercial start-up stage. This extension focuses on refining the curriculum by implementing lessons learned in the first three years of the program, developing new teams and generating more successful transitions, as well as implementing the new financing model that will assure future program sustainability without further government funding.

    The Utah I-Corps Site enhances and builds upon this institution's existing expertise in medical device innovation, commercialization and entrepreneurship. This Site initiated the development of a model of transitioning from research-based technologies to viable commercial products in academic environment that allows the university to expand their innovation programs, provide more impactful resources to faculty and student innovation teams and improve recruitment of underrepresented participants. This extension further generalizes and disseminates the developed curriculum and implements agreements and procedures to assure its future financial sustainability. Partnership networks within the university support underrepresented student and faculty groups and offer the support and resources needed to help such groups thrive and participate in the process and, as the program becomes self-sustaining, will be extended, through internships and special courses to other colleges and local high schools. Thus, the program helps increase the diversity of the regional business environment leading to enhanced growth and economic prosperity for all citizens in the region.

    of over $600M per year. This research generates over 150 patents each year and
    more than $15M in licensing income annually. A challenge is to transition research
    outcomes to the commercialization stage. The Rutgers University I-Corps Site cultivates
    this pool of early stage ideas and assists with bringing viable concepts through
    the commercialization pathway to the marketplace. Through the I-Corps Site, with
    targeted training and mentoring, I-Corps teams are sourced from the Rutgers Site
    partners. These include the Office of Research Commercialization, educational
    activities ranging from the Collaboration for Technology Entrepreneurship and
    Commercialization (CTEC) and Professional Science Master's (PSM) programs, senior-year
    \"capstone\" engineering design and Honors College programs, and many other feeder
    programs. Mentors are matched to these teams. Inventors benefit from the larger
    innovation ecosystem in the New Jersey/New York region, as the Site partners with
    the NYCRIN I-Corps Node. \n\nThe Rutgers I-Corps Site provides training, mentoring,
    and access to a large network of business, technical and financial resources.
    The signature activity of this program is that each year, 30 teams participate
    and test the commercial potential of their products with a broad base of consumers.
    This program promotes the value of commercialization to both faculty and students,
    and reinforces the concept that ideas generated by the academic research process
    can have societal and commercial value.\n\nThe Rutgers I-Corps bridges the gap
    between the lab and the marketplace, enhancing the University's commitment to
    fostering economic development across New Jersey and beyond. As the number of
    spin-outs from the university increases, jobs are created and companies hire students
    as interns and graduates as full-time employees. The program's impact goes beyond
    the University by tapping into local business leaders and entrepreneurs for team
    mentorship as well as expanding programs to support the communities around Rutgers
    campuses and to particularly assist underrepresented inventors and business-owners.
    A key area of focus is to increase I-Corps participation from women in STEM and
    ultimately to increase the number of women-owned businesses in the region/state."

    I-Corps Type II proposal is to continue the existing NSF I-Corps Site program
    at MIT. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted
    by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals
    may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted
    by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals
    may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.\n\nThis Site will continue
    to support MIT researchers that are working on new, innovative and differentiating
    technologies. To date, over seventy teams have participated in the MIT I-Corps
    Site training programs and the total will be well over 100 by the end of the initial
    award. Ten teams have completed the NSF National Team Program and two more have
    been accepted. Collectively, the graduates have received over $8 million in additional
    grants or awards to continue developing their technologies. Six companies have
    submitted SBIR or STTR proposals and four have been awarded so far. Two companies
    were accepted into accelerator programs. The startups have raised over $6.5 million
    in early stage investment and at least twenty-five new jobs have been created.
    Three of the companies have successfully reached commercialization of their publicly
    funded new technologies. Additional outcomes show that participants learn new
    skills both professionally as well as in entrepreneurship. The training contributes
    to their current research and has affected how they will conduct their future
    research by including commercialization potential as part of their planning. Site
    participants benefit from a Team Mentoring approach through a partnership with
    the MIT Venture Mentoring Service that continues beyond their I-Corps training.
    The mentor team framework increases rates of learning and provides continuity
    in nurturing the teams as they advance their ideas.\n\nMIT's activities are likely
    to have broad impact including: encouraging entrepreneurial aspirations and providing
    researchers with training and activities to understand the entrepreneurial process
    allowing them to greatly increase their future prospects while still within the
    academic environment; attracting and supporting a greater number of students,
    faculty and other researchers to actively explore the possibilities of translating
    their research into future commercial applications, ensuring the supply needed
    to fuel the continuous flow of innovations needed by society; and, encouraging
    more women and other underrepresented participants to become engaged and reach
    successful outcomes, serving as visible role models to accelerate the participation
    of others. Finally, through its existing and active Outreach Program, MIT VMS
    will disseminate both the knowledge and practical techniques to its large and
    growing network of universities that have launched mentoring programs based upon

    to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.
    I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute
    to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
    investors.\n\nThis Site leverages Northeastern's entrepreneurship ecosystem as
    well as that of the larger Boston innovation ecosystem. The foundation for the
    program is a growing body of funded research which offers untapped opportunities
    for commercialization. To facilitate entrepreneurship, Northeastern created a
    series of entrepreneurship courses for undergraduate and graduate students, as
    well as an on-campus incubator feeding ventures into the local investment community.\n\nThe
    Northeastern I-Corps Site program substantially increases both the quantity and
    quality of STEM-related ventures founded through its Site. The I-Corps Site program
    also leverage Northeastern's technology licensing office as well as its Mentor
    and Investors Networks in support of Site teams. There are 280 active individual
    Mentors supporting Northeastern's startups, as well as a variety of angel and
    venture capital investors who regularly assess Northeastern ventures, fifty of
    which have garnered $70 million in venture finance over the past three years.
    \n\nNortheastern University's entrepreneurship system is based on the meta-process
    of Educate, Incubate, and Launch. The I-Corp Site program is a highly focused
    way to a) better recruit a specific graduate, postdoc, and faculty population
    of potential technological entrepreneurs, and b) provide initial entrepreneurship
    and innovation education and training for them. Northeastern is also conducting
    research to more clearly understand the effect of entrepreneurial learning for
    first time entrepreneurs in its own incubator, focusing on the specific areas
    of developing customer insight, new product and service solutions, and business
    models. Several I-Corp ventures are already part of this study.\n\nNortheastern's
    Site goals are to increase the number and quality of technology ventures emerging
    from laboratories and to feed new ventures into the I-Corps National program.
    Another important impact is that I-Corps offers a complementary pathway for early
    stage ventures to pursue initial funding through I-Corps Node and SBIR/STTR programs.
    Another potential impact is the expansion of this program in subsequent years
    to early stage entrepreneurs working in the numerous research environments within
    one mile of the Northeastern campus. These institutions include the medical schools
    and hospitals affiliated with Harvard, Tufts, and Boston University, as well as
    organizations pursuing research in robotics, cybersecurity, and IoT among other

Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    NYU Tandon School of Engineering (NYU-SoE) Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) will "encourage and support diversity in STEM entrepreneurship, among women in particular, by encouraging social entrepreneurship, an approach that has shown to be attractive to women." Using the Lean LaunchPad approach infused with insights into supporting diversity, teams will receive funding for customer discovery, prototyping, and other resources to support commercialization across multiple academic terms. This approach is supported by a strong network of faculty and mentors who have exhibited an excellent record of previous NSF funding and commercialization successes.

    The intellectual merit of this proposal incorporates the proposition that social entrepreneurship is more attractive to underrepresented groups, particularly women. By pursuing avenues that will increase diversity in both STEM and entrepreneurship, through the training, programs, and mentorship of the site, this project may serve as an exemplar for I-Corps nationally.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This project, at UC-Irvine, integrates units across campus, focuses on minorities and is likely to have an impact both on the campus and on the regional ecosystem. The Site is built on an already existing 31K sq. ft. collaborative facility, providing a rich environment for commercialization. The I-Corps Site focuses on research strengths such as photonics, nanotechnology, bioengineering, chemistry, medical and life sciences, and transportation. The institution has a large percentage of low-income students, and ranks first among UC institutions for Latino freshman applications, and second in African-American freshman applications. They have a good plan for accessing these students, as well as STEM students. In addition, the Center has helped create businesses with socially conscious missions.

    This project, from the University of California San Diego (UCSD) creates an extension and expansion of their current I-Corps Site. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This Site is the outcome of a Type II proposal from UCSD. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals: Type I - Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site; Type II - Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. The UCSD Type II project proposed continuation and expansion of USCD's existing I-Corps Site, expanding target teams from 30 to 50 annually, integrating collaboration with the existing StartupXX program to nurture female entrepreneurs, adding leadership and team dynamics workshops in collaboration with an existing center on campus, and extending mentoring for I-Corps teams by six months. The Site also builds on a solid track record of success from first round I-Corps Site funding. The extensions to the existing Site are well-conceived, with clearly defined goals, and push the envelope of programming with the requested new funding. Their Site effectively leverages and integrates complementary existing programs, across disciplines, in a strong campus and regional ecosystem.

    This proposal from the University of Virginia (UVA) creates and I-Corps Site at this institution. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The UVA I-Corps Site is a natural extension of the entrepreneurship efforts already in place on the campus. UVA has an extensive set of offerings for its students to learn about the basics of entrepreneurship. The University also has resources for proof of concept that fund teams building prototypes and testing product market fit. The UVA Site will provide the opportunity for early-stage support to help nascent teams take the first step toward commercialization. The Site will help fill the gap between a potentially marketable idea developed in one of the academic centers on campus and several existing translational funds that can provide more meaningful support for a promising start-up team, such as the Coulter Translational Research Partnership, the Biomedical Innovation Fund, the LaunchPad for Diabetes, and the LVG Seed Fund. The fit of the I-Corps program into the existing ecosystem makes UVA a very strong candidate for an I-Corps site. The project will have predictable broader impacts through its effect on the local and regional ecosystems - enabling the launch of new ventures to create jobs and improve the economy.

    This project, from the University of Toledo, will extend and expand their current Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Site. I-Corps Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The University of Toledo is repositioning their site program into one that will directly support commercialization of faculty-led research. This is a shift away from the focus of their prior site grant, which supported interdisciplinary, undergraduate-student entrepreneurship. The goal of their new site program is to send teams to the national I-Corps program and prepare them for applying for SBIR and other external funding. They will hold four short courses each year, for 30+ teams. The Site and their personnel have been active nationally, are producing successful teams, are sending teams to the National program, and are launching companies. They have built a Mentor pool to support their teams. They have strong comprehension of the I-Corps program and close collaboration with their regional I-Corps Node. The existence of a Site in Toledo has already had an impact on the region's ecosystem and also at the state level. Leveraging the two I-Corps Sites in Ohio (at Toledo and Akron), the state of Ohio legislated I-Corps@Ohio to expand the support commercialization. The Toledo Site also collaborates with the Rocket Venture Fund and other incubator facilities.

    This project, from the City University of New York (CUNY) creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.  Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This particular Site plan is unusual in that it involves spreading the I-Corps program to the Community College (CC) population, as well as to other affiliated institutions. CUNY has a large CC component overall in its student population. Its approach to serving the CC population is creative and potentially adoptable and is likely to impact a large population. Not only will teams be recruited along traditional channels and through community colleges, eight CUNY campuses currently participate in a coordinated undergraduate research program, a source of additional undergraduate teams.

    The institution (as well as its affiliates) are extremely diverse. For example, 60% of the student population is female. A large portion is economically challenged. Other typically underrepresented cohorts in STEM (Hispanics, racial minorities, etc.) also make up a large portion of the student population. Consequently, the expectation is that entrepreneurial culture changes are likely to be profound for this population. Overall, this Site could serve as a national model for inclusion.

    This is a proposal to create an I-Corps Site at the University of California - Santa Cruz (UC-SC). The proposal outlines a focused summer program of eight weeks targeted at the under-represented population of the university. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    Particular strengths of the proposal include: offering the I-Corps curriculum during a summer program that is well articulated; targeting under-served students in a region with potential for significant impact; an unusual mix of social, not-for-profit startups with for-profit ones; a strong collaboration with the Bay Area I-Corps Node; the commitment from the university to support the I-Corps focused activities; and, there is likely to be an impact not only on the region but also on the students, 25% of who are Hispanic. This project could potentially serve as a model for others to replicate.

    This project, from Mississippi State University, establishes an I-Corps Site in the institution's Center for Entrepreneurship and Outreach (CEO).  NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. The Mississippi State CEO coordinates the efforts of the Office of Technology Management (OTM) and the E-Center to administer the I-Corps Site project. The goal is to recruit and manage thirty teams a year, with the objective of creating viable businesses based on university research.

    Mississippi State has combined their entrepreneurship center with outreach under an EDA University Center - creating the potential for better than average connections with regional businesses and recruiting representatives of those businesses to participate in the I-Corps Site activities. MS has already solidified some company connections and recruited an advisory board.

    There are clear goals for the Site and Mississippi State University has already started to translate research into businesses. Their existing entrepreneurship program is in line with I-Corps and this grant will help them scale-up those efforts. They have experience collaborating with the Southwest I-Corps Node and plans to continue that collaboration. They have a way to support teams that develop new ideas as well as an I-Corps-centric curriculum in place. They have a robust tracking/assessment plan for the program and the individual teams, an asset to the proposal and will help them to measure the impact of the program.

    The site has the potential to have high in on economically distressed and minority populations.  30% of this institution's entering freshman class and 16% of their faculty belong to minority groups.  In addition there is a program that provides support for veterans starting a business. This is a well-structured and thought out project that contains all of the elements that are needed to support a successful I-Corps Site.  It is clear from data they have provided that a Site at this institution would have a significant impact on the university and the region as well as the faculty and students at this institution.

    This project is a renewal of the Bay Area Regional I-Corps Node to continue creating a robust and broad-based entrepreneurship infrastructure built on the scientific, technology, and engineering strengths as well as the business thought leadership of three globally recognized universities, the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Stanford University. This I-Corps Node will continue building on its success of applying and disseminating the Lean Launchpad methodology through classes and training for both new trainers and early-stage startups. These startups will drive creation of sustainable, scalable science and technology-based startups with both regional and national impacts. The I-Corps Node also will raise awareness of the value of entrepreneurship among science and engineering faculty and students, using specialized programs to drive forcing mechanisms for collaboration. The success of the I-Corps Node itself will be the subject of continual evaluation and analysis, consistent with Lean LaunchPad principles, to develop and disseminate best practices for this region and the nation. A central focus of the Node's work will be finding more efficient ways of solving the two-sided market of connecting scientific and technical talent with business talent. A key question that will be elucidated by this I-Corps Node's research is whether structured mechanisms or a more organic approach will achieve the most favorable outcomes.

    The partner schools have been key contributors to the National Innovation Network in the development of new curriculum and advanced tools. The Node will continue to disseminate the Lean LaunchPad classes widely throughout the Node via classes like Hacking For Defense at Stanford. The Node will also create specialized programs for government funded research centers within universities and governmental agencies ,such as NSA, with the ultimate goal of financial sustainability. The training products and programs created by the I-Corps Node will have broad impact through their widespread dissemination throughout the Node network and beyond. All activities and programs at the I-Corps Node will facilitate the inclusion of groups from diverse regions, economic backgrounds, and ethnicities.

- abstractText: |-
    This project by the University of Michigan I-Corps Node, one of the founding NSF I-Corps nodes, will expand the founding Node into a comprehensive regional node called I-Corps Midwest. I-Corps Midwest Node brings together the University of Michigan (UM) as the lead institution, and the University of Illinois Urbana Champagne, and Purdue University as partner institutions. This Node is uniquely suited to serve the Midwest entrepreneurial ecosystem by bridging rural communication gaps that typically lead to an uninformed commercial opportunity around research inventions, difficulty in retaining and accessing talent with sufficient breadth of specific and relevant expertise, and instilling customer discovery memory across I-Corps programs allowing entrepreneurial researchers to leverage learning from previous I-Corps teams.

    This project will create mechanisms to overcome the consequences of low ecosystem density by building on the existing partner university collaborations and create an active and cohesive network that leverages their collective commercialization pipeline, previous experiences, and connections. The Node will form a deeper understanding of the individual motivations and experiences of the faculty and students as they participate in I-Corps programs. This knowledge will help to continue driving culture change at these institutions and create the innovation human capital needed to move research ideas forward into the marketplace. The Node will create measurements of network activity and the resulting outcomes will provide information on which methodologies are effective and should be propagated to other regional clusters and the nation. This project builds on the previous four years of work by NSF to create collaborations that are critically important for institutions that are not located in entrepreneurially dense areas to reach and prepare individuals to compete on a national and international level.

    node called I-Corps South. I-Corps South Node brings together the Georgia Institute
    of Technology (GT) as the lead institution, and the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa,
    the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the University of Tennessee Knoxville
    as partner institutions. I-Corps South will introduce the labs, colleges, and
    universities throughout the Southeast to the entrepreneurial education, ultimately
    increasing commercialization outcomes in each of the participating states. The
    I-Corps South Node will reach more than half a million graduate and undergraduate
    students, and many thousands of the nation's research faculty.\n\nThis project
    provides I-Corps training and infrastructure to share the model I-Corps curriculum
    with regional affiliates. The primary institutions of I-Corps South will leverage
    their extensive industry relationships, partnerships, mentors, and funding connections
    to bring economic development through startup formation, workforce development,
    and entrepreneurial education. The Node will serve its region's research universities
    and HBCUs via a robust affiliates program. The I-Corps South Node's research contribution
    will lead to an understanding of how NSF-funded teams can be better supported
    to commercialize inventions, and uncover why some academics choose to become entrepreneurs,
    while others do not participate in commercialization activities. I-Corps South
    is also creating a pilot program to create an intelligent support system for I-Corps
    instructors, built upon IBM's Watson. \n\nThis project's planned activities will
    expand the I-Corps curriculum repertoire for effective entrepreneurship training,
    creating a long-lasting impact on the region's teams and entrepreneurs. Its geographically
    dispersed collaborative network of Sites and affiliates will accelerate the development
    of the South's entrepreneurial ecosystems, and provide for increased partnership
    opportunities between academia and industry. The recruitment of new national I-Corps
    teams will increase the impact of the federally funded research. Finally, its
    focus on underrepresented minorities through programs at HBCUs and in Puerto Rico
    will increase the participation of those individuals in entrepreneurship, improving
    their well-being and inspiring future generations to pursue research and job creation
    activities, a clear and substantial benefit to society."

    Customer Discovery process. Aggie I-Corps provides teams with training, resources,
    networking opportunities, and seed funding to move their ventures towards the
    market, along with a range of follow-on funding through local competitions, NSF
    I-Corps, SBIR/STTR, and private investors. Aggie I-Corps is offered three times

    a competitive application process intended to identify innovations across campus
    in areas typically funded by the NSF.\n\nA novel aspect of the Aggie I-Corps program
    is the focus on Value Proposition Design as opposed to Business Model Design,
    which is the subject of most I-Corps and Lean LaunchPad programs. The purpose
    for the shift to Value Proposition Design is to focus on the two most challenging
    segments of Business Model Canvas: Customer Segments and Value Propositions. The
    core hypothesis is that dedicated training using Value Proposition Canvas will
    serve as a better introduction to entrepreneurship and the Lean LaunchPad methodology
    than starting with the full Business Model Canvas. If successful, the Aggie I-Corps
    could serve as a model for introductory entrepreneurship programs and future I-Corps
    Sites preparing teams for the National I-Corps program.\n\nNMSU and Arrowhead
    have been growing a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship on campus, particularly
    through their Studio G, NMSU/Arrowhead's student business accelerator. In the
    past two years, 80 new member startups were added, involving over 150 student
    entrepreneurs. This rapid growth signifies a large demand for entrepreneurship
    training at NMSU. Aggie I-Corps is an opportunity to build on this current momentum
    and offer student entrepreneurs dedicated training and support to pursue their
    own startups. Aggie I-Corps offers the initial capital for participants to pursue
    their projects to the point of raising additional funding by leveraging the training
    and market research gained through the program. Aggie I-Corps positions STEM-based
    entrepreneurs to win follow-on funding through local competitions, federal funding
    applications and private investment solicitations. \n\nAggie I-Corps is having
    a significant impact on the improvement of the culture of entrepreneurship and
    innovation at NMSU, which yields dividends beyond the training and funding of
    Aggie I-Corps participants. The impact goes beyond the university and contributes
    to the regional ecosystem of entrepreneurship."

    Hampshire (UNH).\n\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities
    established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple,
    local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites
    provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training
    and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace
    or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \n\nUNH's I-Corps Site enables faculty
    researchers and trainees to explore the commercial potential of their discoveries.
    The application of the Lean Launchpad (LLP) curriculum, intellectual networking
    events, access to business and scientific mentors, and funding mechanisms help
    participants in identifying the critical path to commercialization and ways to
    reach the market with innovative ideas more efficiently. UNH Innovation, which
    is the unit primarily responsible for entrepreneurial activities and technology
    commercialization at UNH, hosts the I-Corps Site.\n\nUNH's existing commercialization
    infrastructure is coordinated to increase the likelihood that research can be
    quickly exposed to the I-Corps program. At least 30 I-Corps Teams are trained
    each year and participate in the UNH Flywheel process. Highlights of this innovative
    process include:\n   (1) Exposure to a four-week Lean Launch Pad (LLP) course
    focusing on customer discovery and value proposition; \n   (2) A 10-week LLP course
    with exposure to the entire business model canvas; \n   (3) A demo day to showcase
    ideas; and \n   (4) Twice-yearly Sandpits, where multiple subject matter experts
    are invited to an open discussion on a general topic to promote interdisciplinary
    and trans-disciplinary conversations. \nPromising projects are connected to business
    mentors, are eligible for new translational funding, and are provided access to
    local incubator and angel/venture capital networks to accelerate market entry
    of ideas.\n\nImplementation of this I-Corp Site constitutes a redesign of the
    ecosystem in such a way as to increase interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary
    collaboration throughout UNH's $110MM research portfolio, and develop connections
    to available resources necessary to ensure that discoveries fulfill their economic
    and social potential. \n\nTo assess the impact of this redesign, this proposal
    contains an innovative approach to program assessment. While tracking well-established
    metrics such as invention disclosures, licenses, and startup activity, UNH also
    tracks qualitative and social network measures to help assess deeper changes in
    UNH?s innovation ecosystem. This more robust measurement approach not only assists
    in future improvements in UNH's innovation ecosystem, but also increases the scalability
    and transferability of lessons learned and insights gained at UNH?' I-Corps Site
    to the national innovation network.\n\nThe UNH Site impacts transcend exposure
    to and access by faculty and students to LLP coursework.  Startup formation and
    job creation are expanded as a direct result of UNH research and an improved culture
    of commercialization on campus. The UNH Flywheel process (1) exposes the regional
    and national business communities to UNH?s research capacity, (2) increases research
    collaborations between faculty and industry; and (3) improves connections between
    graduate students and the local business community. The program works with existing
    organizations on campus like the Society for Women Engineers, Luna Cats, UNH ADVANCE,
    UNH chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, and the Associate Vice
    President for Community, Equity, and Diversity to ensure recruitment and enrollment
    for programs is well advertised and broadens the participation of underrepresented
    cohorts in commercialization."

    at the University of New Hampshire'
- abstractText: "This project, from Dartmouth College, creates an Innovation Corps
    Site.\n\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established
    at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams
    to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure,
    advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable
    groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
    Team applicants. \nI-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally
    and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs
    and investors.\n\nDartmouth's I-Corps Site provides intensive entrepreneurial
    training following the Lean LaunchPad curriculum and resources for customer discovery
    and market need analysis to 90-112 teams of students, faculty, researchers, and
    mentors.  The program bridges campus wide research in science, engineering, medicine,
    and student projects, all of which can lead to potential innovations - with Dartmouth's
    suite of entrepreneurial services offered through its Office of Entrepreneurship
    and Technology Transfer (OETT). \n\nThe intellectual merit of Dartmouth's I-Corps
    Site is the creation of a consistent curriculum that helps scientists, engineers,
    and students frame their discoveries in the context of how they can be used outside
    of the academic institution. The program helps a nascent entrepreneurs to place
    their discovery into one of three categories: continued academic exploration,
    pursuit of its use within the market discovered through program participation,
    or reevaluation with the intent of determining whether a market and need exists
    in a completely different area. \n\nThe objective of the Dartmouth I-Corps Site
    is to engage and equip more students and researchers at all levels - undergraduate,
    graduate, post-doctoral, and faculty - to move their discoveries out of academia
    and into the marketplace. Dartmouth I-Corps Lean LaunchPad workshops are held
    twice annually during Dartmouth's interim periods in December and June.  Using
    the workshops as a springboard and seed funding from the grant, teams perform
    customer discovery, form a value proposition, and determine market need and size
    beginning with the workshop and for a three-month period following the workshop.
    After completing the program, participants are prepared to either rethink their
    discovery or move forward with commercialization. If a team concludes that a discovery
    has commercial value, the team will be well positioned to take advantage of the
    support of the OETT, the NSF I-Corps program, Dartmouth's alumni support network,
    local angel investors, and other organizations.\n\nBroader Impacts: \nThe broader
    impacts of this program lie in its objective to create a campus environment that
    fosters innovation and produces graduates who understand and can engage in defining
    value and identifying need as they launch their careers. Dartmouth's enrollment
    of underrepresented minorities and women in its undergraduate and graduate STEM
    programs significantly exceed national averages; women represent 42% and 48%,
    respectively, of the current senior and junior engineering classes, and 30% of
    declared Computer Science majors. Sciences consistently enroll approximately 50%
    women. The engineering school's first-of-its-kind Ph.D. Innovation program, established
    in 2008, has graduated 30% women or underrepresented minorities. Feeders into
    Dartmouth's I-Corps Sites program come from courses and research laboratories
    from across Dartmouth's college of Arts & Sciences and three professional schools
    and all levels and engage these traditionally underrepresented populations in
    innovation as a natural outcome of the project activities. In order to broaden
    impact to the years beyond the I-Corps grant, investigators will use project outcomes
    to seek alumni support for offering of the Site curriculum and seed funding programs
    semi-annually."

    and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs
    and investors.\n\nThe objective of the TTU I-Corps Site is to strengthen the innovation
    ecosystem and entrepreneurial community in the TN region through the delivery
    of the I-Corps curriculum and support to 30+ teams per year. This activity will
    leverage existing partnerships between Tennessee Technological University (TTU),
    ORNL and the Biz Foundry to accelerate commercialization through training, enhanced
    education, and support of innovative research, while capitalizing on the existing
    university research infrastructure and the Launch Tennessee (LaunchTN) accelerator
    network. The TTU Site builds on the existing research experience at TTU by adding
    specific commercialization training and experience for teams that are composed
    of various combinations of students, faculty, members of industry and scientists.
    The TTU I-Corps Site expands the innovation and technical commercialization infrastructure
    at TTU by:\n     1) Building skill sets among students, faculty, engineers and
    community startups, and\n     2) Moving technology from academia, government,
    and industry toward commercialization. \nThis project achieves the goals of the
    Innovation Corps Sites Program by facilitating the translation of research, encouraging
    collaboration between academia and industry, and training students to understand
    innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E). This funding allows TTU to support teams
    whose projects are likely candidates for commercialization.\n\nThe innovation
    Site at TTU is built around the national I-Corps model, and its focused training
    experience, and consists of three stages to recruit, immerse and support technical
    entrepreneurs in the innovation and entrepreneurship lifecycle. The stages are:\n
    \    1) Team origination and recruitment \n     2) Formal I-Corps training\n     3)
    Post-training support\nThese stages are designed to improve the pathway to successful
    commercialization and develop the participants as better innovators and contributors
    to the NSF I-Corps network. \n\nTennessee (TN) state entrepreneurial startups,
    as exemplified by SBIR/STTR funding, fall in the 3rd quartile ranking with a 37%
    decrease in the past two decades. Until recently, most TN entrepreneurs have had
    limited or no access to training or opportunities to grow their startup. The TTU
    Site participates in and contributes to the broader knowledge of entrepreneurship
    research and its impact on engineering education and adds to the database of innovators
    in the NSF I-Corps network. In particular, this Site aids in understanding the
    role of entrepreneurship and innovation engineering education and its potential
    impact on: critical thinking; the network of emerging entrepreneurs and mentors;
    and, the addition of business students into the I-Corps model. The Site will investigate
    the early implementation of a quantitative, nationalized assessment model, based
    on the existing Critical Thinking Assessment (CAT) tool, appropriate for the I-Corps
    model that could be extended to train the larger innovation community."

    is a novel partnership involving two Historically Black Colleges and Universities
    (HBCUs), with assistance from the DC I-Corps Node, a regional I-Corps node supporting
    the DC-MD-VA region. The partnership supports enhanced participation of HBCU students
    and faculty from Howard and Hampton universities in technology transfer and venture
    creation by leveraging DC I-Corps' expertise in the Lean Launch Pad philosophy
    and curriculum. DC I-Corps benefits from the Site's regional alignment to accelerate
    the participation of African-Americans in future I-Corps Node cohorts thereby
    enhancing diversity. I-Corps activities on each campus and assessment of these
    targeted programs also informs strategies for improving innovation and entrepreneurship
    interventions aimed at under-represented minorities (URM) and enhance ongoing
    educational research.\n\nThese institutions are uniquely positioned among the
    HBCUs to undertake this effort. Both institutions are among the inaugural cohort
    of HBCUs participating in the HBCU Innovation and Entrepreneurship Collaborative
    (IEC) organized by the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and the Association of
    Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) to stimulate innovation activity on
    HBCU campuses. The IEC effort connects HBCUs with best practices to implementing
    entrepreneurship and innovation activities on campus. These best practices are
    based on models advocated by Stanford University and the National Collegiate Inventors
    and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA - recently renamed VentureWell), among others.
    \n\nThe partnership between the Howard and Hampton University Site and the DC
    I-Corps Node allows for greater opportunities to assess diversity as a variable
    in innovation and entrepreneurship programming interventions targeting under-represented
    minorities; enhancing fundamental understanding of effective frameworks for LLP
    education for diverse populations. Additionally, the Site seeks to increase technical
    entrepreneurship participation among the HBCU faculty and students by focusing
    on the following activities:\n\n1.\tIncreasing the training of HBCU faculty and
    students in Lean Launchpad methodology.\n2.\tDeveloping a strong inter-related
    network of HBCU entrepreneurs with the NSF I-Corps system. \n3.\tOrganizing and
    growing a diverse mentorship network. \n4.\tEncouraging applications from in response

    Site funding will catalyze and accelerate faculty and student efforts to commercialize
    original research and new technologies by providing financial support for prototypes
    and customer engagement. Lean Startup training will help teams discover their
    potential customers and product-market fit. \n\nNJIT's support for entrepreneurs
    has four main anchors: the Enterprise Development Center, a 100,000-sq.-foot high
    technology and life sciences business incubator; the newly established NJ Innovation
    Institute; the NJ Innovation Acceleration Center, an initiative of School of Management
    and the Office of Technology Development; and the NJIT Undergraduate Research
    and Innovation initiative where students form interdisciplinary teams and participate
    in experiential research activities that can solve societal problems.  An NSF
    I-Corps Site at NJIT will help bridge one of the roadblocks to the commercialization
    of research by providing funds for the development of risky early-stage prototypes.
    Faculty/Student teams seeking financial support will be required to participate
    in Lean Startup training and entrepreneurial networking that will help them to
    transition from researchers to potential innovators and entrepreneurs. \n\nAn
    NSF I-Corps Site at NJIT will establish a robust pathway to market for original
    research and new technologies by cross-fertilizing academic, entrepreneurial,
    and corporate participation. The grant will further enhance NJIT's relationship
    with the entrepreneurial and corporate communities as we bring community members
    onto campus as mentors for the I-Corps Site teams. \n\nAn I-Corps Site at NJIT
    will create pathway for underrepresented teams to participate in the NSF I-Corps
    program and support the mission of promoting science and technology to advance
    the national health. By combining academic research activities with commercialization
    activities, the I-Corp Site at NJIT will foster experiential teaching, training,
    and learning for students and faculty. Students and faculty who learn to discover
    the path to commercialization will be able to view research discoveries with greater
    understanding.\n\nThe Kauffman Foundation has recognized that minorities are underrepresented
    among entrepreneurs. All entrepreneurs face resource constraints but the barriers
    to entrepreneurship may be insurmountable for economically disadvantaged students
    and students who don't have a strong network from which to derive resources. An
    NSF I-Corp Site at NJIT will draw students from one of the most diverse campuses
    within the US and will provide early stage funding to women, minorities, and economically
    disadvantaged participants on a meritocratic basis. \n\nLeveling the playing field
    will broaden participation from underrepresented groups and create a new class
    of technology entrepreneurs and will benefit society by helping to move ideas
    out of academic silos. Nearly all net new job growth in the US has come from the
    formation of new companies and the subset of new companies that have grown most
    rapidly has been technology-based companies, the sorts of technology startups

    marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen
    innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network
    of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe UNC Charlotte I-Corp
    Site, the Ventureprise Charlotte Launch Program, enables a substantial expansion
    of faculty and student customer discovery and startup participation by building
    upon programs and resources that are underway at the University. UNC Charlotte,
    through its Charlotte Research Institute and Ventureprise organizations, offers
    an integrated series of programs that directly address early idea identification,
    customer discovery, startup and growth stage guidance. \n\nThe I-Corps Site funding
    at UNC improves visibility of entrepreneurship, incent broad student and faculty
    participation, and drives commercialization opportunities that leverage the University's
    major investment in innovation and entrepreneurship personnel and infrastructure.
    \ The Ventureprise Charlotte Launch Program is likely to yield insights into best
    practices applicable to a public university with a diverse student population
    that includes many first generation college students. The program operates in
    a region with strong corporate operations and modest venture capital presence
    and is designed to engage corporate partners in team evaluation and guidance.
    \n\nBroader Impacts:\nUNC Charlotte serves more than 26,000 students with a substantial
    population of underrepresented minorities (23% African-American and Hispanic)
    and numerous students from modest economic circumstances. The UNC I-Corps Site
    focuses on this population and on reducing the barriers to STEM entrepreneurial
    participation by all motivated and qualified UNC Charlotte students.\n\nThe rapidly
    growing Charlotte region with 2.6 million residents and strong corporate presence
    participate in the Ventureprise Charlotte Launch Program through mentor engagement
    and community entrepreneur involvement. This creates linkages between the diverse
    student population and community resources, strengthening student network access.
    The I-Corps evidence-based customer discovery methodologies have broader economic
    impact as they infuse the region's innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem.
    The I-Corps Site funding increases engagement of University faculty and students
    with corporate innovation executives located in the Carolinas. This program strengthens
    and expands partnerships among the University, industry, and the entrepreneurial
    community. These partnerships directly affect commercialization and are likely
    to lead to additional collaborative research and other positive outcomes."

    Site accelerates commercialization of technologies developed by UI faculty, students
    and community-based entrepreneurs and has invested in campus-wide infrastructure
    to foster innovation and technology commercialization. Core university entrepreneurship
    and technology commercialization operating units are closely aligned to ensure
    effective and rapid implementation of the UI I-Corps program. The UI has strong
    working relationships with external stakeholders for identifying experienced entrepreneurial
    leaders and mentors and securing financial capital from angel investors, venture

    of a UI I-Corps program significantly improves the campus' entrepreneurial eco-system
    by providing funding for new strategic investments in entrepreneurship education
    and support while leveraging existing commercialization activities.\n\nAt the
    core of the UI I-Corps program is entrepreneurial training; UI Venture School
    is an entrepreneurial training program based on the LeanLaunch Pad and Business
    Model Canvas. The UI offers 6-8 entrepreneurial educational programs annually,
    serving a minimum of 30 commercialization teams. In addition to training, the
    university launches 1) several business and technical support initiatives for
    I-Corps teams including the Summer Accelerator-a 90-day new venture launch program,
    2) UI ProtoLabs-a prototype development program, 3) UI Ventures-a comprehensive
    technical and business development initiative, 4) UI Mentoring-a mentoring program
    connecting UI faculty and students to entrepreneurs, investors and technical experts,
    and 5) a SBIR/STTR grant development assistance program.  \n\nBroader Impacts:\nThe
    UI I-Corps program incorporates mechanisms that may demonstrate the potential
    for how universities can successfully build a campus-wide, interconnected entrepreneurial
    ecosystem through interdisciplinary education and innovation, collaboration with
    colleges, centers, and research units, and partnerships with the private sector.
    UI I-Corps program is expected to: increase the number of UI startup companies;
    intensify interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty, students, entrepreneurs,
    investors and private sector companies; expand the entrepreneurial management
    talent of UI faculty and student entrepreneurs; and support the development and
    commercialization of new technologies designed to solve significant societal challenges.
    \ \n\nIn addition, female entrepreneurs and female led startup companies is the
    focus of the UI I-Corps project. Startup companies led by female CEOs and CTOs
    represent a small fraction of entrepreneurs. The goal of the BI is to increase
    the number of female entrepreneurs on campus to be equal to their male counterpart
    within 5 years. Key elements of the BI approach include: 1) targeted grant funding
    for Gap and startup activities for female entrepreneurs, 2) one-on-one mentoring
    that pairs successful female entrepreneurs with each new female led startup, 3)
    formal recognition of accomplishments, grants and awards by female entrepreneurs,
    4) bringing successful hi-tech female entrepreneurs to campus for publicized seminars
    and one-on-one sessions, 5) developing a network of female entrepreneurs for support,

    With the support and mentorship of the Sites, the teams will learn first-hand
    about entrepreneurship and explore the transition of their ideas, devices, processes
    or other intellectual activities into the marketplace.\n\nI-Corps Sites also strengthen
    innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network
    of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe goal of the University
    of Louisville (UofL) I-Corps Site program is to integrate and leverage existing
    commercialization infrastructure and capabilities as a collaborative effort between
    the Office of Executive Vice President for Research and Innovation (EVPRI), College
    of Business' Forcht Center for Entrepreneurship (Forcht Center) and the STEM programs
    to establish a sustainable program for the discovery and commercialization of
    STEM innovations and stimulate regional economic development. \n\nThe UofL I-Corps
    Site team will recruit and engage STEM researchers and students to facilitate
    and accelerate the translation of emerging technologies into commercial products
    by providing training and support at all stages of the entrepreneurial discovery
    process. Recruited students and researchers participate in an in-depth entrepreneurship
    education program, based on Stanford's Lean LaunchPad process, conducted by the
    Forcht Center and the EVPRI through Nucleus: Kentucky Innovation Center (Nucleus).
    \n\nThe proposed program implements an Innovation Discovery Grants mechanism ($1,000
    - $3,000) to support entrepreneurial teams in: 1) utilizing the new UofL Institute
    for Product Realization to develop proof of concept and prototypes for promising
    product ideas based on scientific and entrepreneurial merit; 2) customer discovery;
    3) additional entrepreneurial training; and/or 4) traveling to consult with potential
    clients or experts. \n\nThe vision of the program at the University of Louisville
    is to develop a cadre of well-trained, entrepreneurially oriented researchers
    and graduates who can effectively evaluate the commercial potential of new innovations
    and more expediently develop them as the drivers of new business development in
    Louisville, the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the region.  \n\nBroader Impact:\nThis
    project has the potential to contribute to Kentucky's high tech industries, particularly
    in the areas of science and technology. The UofL I-Corps Site will provide a fertile
    environment for STEM entrepreneurial discovery and business development, which
    will stimulate the creation and growth of new, high-tech industries and higher
    paying jobs, while at the same time develop the entrepreneurial infrastructure
    of the state. \n\nFrom an educational perspective, this program will implement
    and evaluate a model for training innovators to extend their focus beyond the
    laboratory by exploring commercialization strategies for their innovations. Training
    outstanding students and researchers with entrepreneurial skills will help recruit
    and retain the best and the brightest in Kentucky and establish an entrepreneurial
    culture of value to the entire state. This program will also reach out to attract
    a diverse student body and group of researchers from under-represented groups
    in the STEM fields. The program will expand and develop a new paradigm at the
    University of Louisville that capitalizes on institutional strengths and resources
    for evaluating the potential, developing and establishing successful entrepreneurial
    ventures in emerging technologies."

    Site brings together and builds on successful programs in three diverse colleges
    and two major entrepreneurial units at BYU: the Rollins Center for Entrepreneurship
    and Technology (CET), and the Technology Transfer Office (TTO). The CET primarily
    addresses student entrepreneurship and the TTO primarily addresses faculty technology
    commercialization needs. \n\nBy providing specifically targeted commercialization
    funds, this I-Corps Site program builds bridges that attract and stimulate both
    faculty and student entrepreneurial activity. Approximately 30 teams each year
    receive I-Corps funds to explore technology commercialization opportunities at
    BYU. Expected outcomes include  (1) formation of startup ventures with students
    as major players, (2) creation of scaling plans suitable for presentation to seed-stage
    investors, (3) increased participation by BYU students in the commercialization
    of faculty-generated IP, and (4) increased participation of women and underrepresented
    participants in BYU student entrepreneurship activities.  \n\nBroader Impacts:\nThis
    program advances knowledge by studying best practices in university-centered technology
    commercialization processes, learning how to better incentivize students and faculty
    at BYU to participate in these processes, and tracking weaknesses in student teams
    to learn how best to blend student energy and creativity with faculty expertise
    and external mentoring. By engaging student teams in the technology commercialization
    process, so they build scalable new ventures, this program will directly create
    greater economic activity, particularly in the inter-mountain west region of the
    USA. This will result in increased job creation along with the other normal outcomes
    of increased economic activity. \n\nThis program will also reach out to women
    and underrepresented participants, thus increasing the diversity of students involved
    in entrepreneurial activities within the BYU ecosystem. As an I-Corps Site, the
    CET's synergistic activity of holding the annual International Business Model
    Competition will gain greater visibility and thus promote the overall goals of
    the I-Corps programs to inculcate customer development and related lean launch

    The Penn Site will employ a structured process for business model validation following
    the Lean Launchpad methodology. Within the context of technologies arising from
    STEM research at Penn, the goals of the Site are to expand PCI?s start-up creation
    services to teams involving faculty and students, provide hands-on experiential
    entrepreneurial education, and accelerate startup-creation at Penn. This project
    will provide a commercialization path for Penn?s educational entrepreneurial activities
    in STEM by expanding PCI?s company formation for faculty/student teams in STEM
    and by adding an entrepreneurial component to PCI?s educational programs.  \n\nBroader
    Impacts:\nA direct result of the PCI-ICS will be hands-on training in the Customer
    Discover Methodology (Blank, 2012) of 90+ faculty and students, creation of business
    plans and pitches suitable to present to partners and investors, the creation
    of new start-ups and, when appropriate, licensing of technologies originating
    from Penn research.  The ultimate goal is to help transition of research to commercialization,
    while integrating education and traditional technology transfer activities by
    promoting a hands-on experiential approach to development of startup ideas. This
    will be accomplished by establishing a framework that acts as a bridge between
    educational coursework and PCI?s company formation programs.  \n\nThe PCI Site
    will help spawn faculty and students trained in fundamental aspects of entrepreneurism.
    A collaboration with the Wharton-SBDC will have the dual impact of providing business
    guidance to entrepreneurs in STEM and exposing business students to STEM areas
    of research. By connecting Penn nascent entrepreneurs with the PCI?s network of
    entrepreneurs, investors, and advisors as well as with the Ben Franklin Technology
    Partners Southeastern Pennsylvania Economic Development Agency and the Mayor of
    the City of Philadelphia, the Penn I-Corps site may be an important contributor
    to the development of dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem in the region."

    Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities
    whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their
    technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice,
    resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups
    to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.
    This is a Type II proposal, requesting a \"renewal\" of funding for an existing
    I-Corps Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals
    are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site.
    These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals
    are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site.
    These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.\n\nThrough
    their initial Site grant, the University of Chicago served approximately 90 STEM
    teams, including innovative faculty, researchers, and students from the University
    of Chicago community and other Chicagoland institutions. Several of these teams
    were successful ? winning further grant funding, raising outside capital, hiring
    staff, and launching companies. Upon the renewal of their Site grant, the Polsky
    Center seeks to: 1) continue serving campus constituents, and 2) broadening access
    of these resources to underserved and underrepresented populations in the Chicagoland
    region whose universities do not currently provide access to Site resources. Through
    this goal, Polsky aims to increase economic development in Illinois and empower
    innovators to test their ideas.\n\nThe Polsky Center has been a recognized leader
    in the development and launch of ventures that create economic value, supporting
    an increasing number of companies launching from technical divisions, including:
    the Computation Institute, the Medical Center, and the Institute for Molecular
    Engineering. Additionally, the University of Chicago manages national laboratories,
    including the Department of Energy Labs Argonne and Fermi, as well as the Marine
    Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. The University of Chicago is committed to
    also supporting technology transfer from these institutions, which have received
    federal funding."

Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The George Washington University Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (OI&E) collaborates with multiple units on campus to dramatically increase student and faculty teams from the STEM disciplines in OI&E innovation and commercialization activities. There is a strong network of mentors who are key in this process. OI&E developed multiple versions of the Lean Startup curriculum and will continue to do so to meet the special needs of undergraduate students, women, minorities, and veterans in the STEM disciplines. OI&E is also creating courseware in support of experienced entrepreneurs, investors, and business professionals who have not yet learned to apply lean startup methods. Doing so brings value to an entire startup ecosystem that is important to startup success. The broader impacts include spreading entrepreneurial thinking among the faculty, developing a well-trained cadre of mentors and adding to the diversity of the pool of mentors, especially women and veterans. These are important goals in entrepreneurship and commercialization and the project is specific about how this Site will advance these broader impacts.

    students to participate in STEM-related business startups. \n\nThe Site grant
    provides 90 teams (over a three year period) $3,000 in funding per team along
    with training in the startup process, creating a culture of business startup and
    technology commercialization activity on campus that will remain in place long
    after the three year I-Corp grant is completed. \n\nThe OSU I-Corp Site impact
    includes the creation of STEM-related startups, licensing opportunities, jobs
    in Oklahoma and beyond, and incentives that attract underrepresented student groups
    to participate in the program. Business startups are particularly important for
    Oklahoma because the state has few Fortune 500 companies and other large employers.
    An increase in STEM-related jobs in Oklahoma bolsters the economy and improves
    the educational experiences of the students that are involved, increasing their
    competitiveness not only as STEM students but as citizens of our state and nation."

    process at the Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE) and transforms processes in its
    Technology Transfer Office (TTO) to facilitate faculty and students to transfer
    STEM research into commercially viable ideas and prototypes. Faculty and students
    are recruited for this Site using pro-active processes such as: visits to classrooms,
    capstone design courses, research projects on campus, undergraduate and graduate
    research displays, individual contacts with faculty with STEM related research
    grants, and invention disclosures. The TTO also helps teams connect with business
    mentors by leveraging current contacts. They also are a resource for finding non-NSF
    funds for innovation-related activities. Faculty from CFE, representing the Colleges
    of Business, Engineering, Medicine and Sustainability, deliver the NSF training
    program in a one-week, intensive boot camp format. \n\nBeyond the prototype stage,
    USF CONNECT, which is the business arm of USF and at the epicenter of Tampa Bay's
    innovation ecosystem, supports the I-Corps teams throughout the business life
    cycle, providing facilities, partners, and resources for business development
    and access to technologies, workforce programs, technology commercialization,
    critical research equipment, and incubator facilities. The I-Corps program results
    in an institutional impact by addressing a crucial gap in the USF innovation ecology
    in creating prototypes and enhancing design. \n\nWith an I-Corps site, the potential
    for increasing STEM technology transfer that feeds Tampa Bay's growing innovation
    ecosystem is high and contributes to transforming the region through high-technology
    startups. USF is an economic anchor for the Tampa Bay region and a node of the
    Florida High Tech Corridor that spans a 23-county region in Florida. Most of the
    state's medical device manufacturing, defense, aerospace, informational technology,
    and life sciences companies reside in this region. \n\nUSF's diverse student population

- abstractText: "This is a proposal to create an I-Corps Site at SUNY at Stony Brook.\n\nNSF
    Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities
    whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their
    technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice,
    resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups
    to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.
    I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute
    to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
    investors.\n\nStony Brook developed a suite of programs for providing science
    and engineering-based assistance to companies with technology needs. This suite
    of programs has been successful in fostering the growth of enterprises, including
    startups. The Stony Brook campus leads SUNY in technology transfer performance
    - invention disclosures, patent applications, issued patents, and executed licenses.
    Its economic development/ industry assistance programs, which assists companies
    of any size at any stage of development, has a track record of promoting company
    growth - more than 3,500 projects, completed with more than 800 companies, have
    generated more than $900 million in corporate revenues. The oldest and largest
    Stony Brook incubator has exited some 80 companies with a 55% success record.\n\nThe
    Stony Brook I-Corps Site will capitalize on the prospective talent within its
    own faculty and student body and the discovery and innovation generated by sponsored
    investments in its research programs. Stony Brook's Site will collaborate with
    the University's academic leadership to focus assets on discovering and nurturing
    a new target, the entrepreneur, and structuring access to assets -  including
    the Long Island REACH Hub - to maximize innovation impact and create a permanent,
    sustainable entrepreneurial pipeline as both beneficiary of and stimulus for a
    larger innovation network.  \n\nAs a region of 2.8M people with a $143B Gross
    Metropolitan Product (2012), Stony Brook's location, Long Island, is larger than
    19 states and a net contributor to New York's fiscal health. Its growth rate,
    however, has lagged the nation since 2010. Strengthening the regional innovation
    ecosystem may have long-term positive economic impacts across the state. Within
    the ecosystem itself, the Stony Brook I-Corps Site will not only transform the
    culture of the Stony Brook campus, creating a permanent vehicle to feed the new
    venture pipeline, which will be strengthened by a synergistic relationship with
    the proposed Long Island REACH Hub, but it will also broaden the impact of the
    established NYCRIN I-Corps Node, in which Stony Brook is a partner, by feeding
    it close to an additional 100 entrepreneurial teams over a three-year period.
    Regionally, the design of the Stony Brook I-Corps Site will extend the Site's
    impact by inviting entrepreneurial researchers from the region's other research
    institutions to participate."

    to make specific enhancements to the Accelerator and increase the number of I-Corps
    Site (ICS) teams. The project's three goals include the following: (1) Enhancing
    linkages with the OSU engineering, science, and business disciplines through a
    faculty liaison program in support of Accelerator ICS teams; (2) Creating and
    delivering new course content on personal development, team formation, and dynamics
    to enable high performing ICS teams; and (3) Providing course materials and tracking
    software to enhance the Lean Canvas curriculum delivery and seed funds for development
    of prototypes and minimum viable products.\n\nMany of the emerging companies OSUAA
    supports help address larger societal issues  such as clean energy and expensive
    healthcare devices. OSUAA provides a supportive environment to allow these cutting-edge
    technologies to develop and find commercialization pathways. Ultimately, the OSUAA
    may serve as a viable model to help develop new business and enhanced employment
    outcomes for other rural land grant institutions engaged in similar research activities.
    \ \n\nThe OSUAA framework to advance the commercialization of research will help
    improve the economic climate and development in the largely rural state of Oregon.
    Oregon, particularly in the rural areas, tends to lag the nation in economic prosperity
    and recovery. Through facilitated launch of new startup companies, the OSU system
    may reduce unemployment through the creation of higher-wage positions in development,
    manufacturing and related support roles. Funded investments in ICS teams accelerate
    the transition of research to market by providing stronger curricular components
    and dedicated resources for prototyping. \n\nOSUAA works across all 11 university
    colleges, which allows for students to actively participate in the real-world,
    experiential aspects of moving research to the marketplace. The OSUAA also works
    closely with the four cultural centers on campus to ensure that traditionally
    underrepresented groups know about, have access to, and take advantage of OSUAA's
    learning opportunities."

    The intellectual merit of this project at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is that the Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures (JHTV) and its accelerator team, FastForward, will support the commercialization of research and technologies to create an innovation ecosystem at the University, and more broadly, in the Baltimore region. This I-Corps Site award enables JHU to leverage research outcomes by providing teams with an essential stipend for customer discovery and prototyping and the ability to validate and test their hypotheses and confirm through customer discovery whether there is value in their technology in the marketplace. By actually getting out of the lab, researchers gain insights into the mindset of decision makers and the payers who may become their customers. This grant will enable the JHU Site to provide a better learning experience for its participants by providing additional, non-dilutive funds.

    For example, in the fall of 2015, JHU's Short Course cohort focused on life sciences and brought together teams from universities across the city. The focused approach allowed instructors to delve into the unique challenges faced by researchers commercializing technology in the life sciences space including the development of strategic partnerships and the need for greater evidence based research at a time when the life science industry is investing less in research and development and easing away from the risks of basic and translational research.

    The I-Corps Site at JHU fills the fundamental educational disconnect between invention and market that is not found inside a lab or classroom but only through customer interviews. The goal of the JHU I-Corps Site will be to advance the knowledge and understanding of the commercial potential of life and basic science research while providing access to the life science expertise of Johns Hopkins to include translation, partnering, and entrepreneurship for the greater National
    Innovation Network.

    Participants in the JHU Site include teams from other universities especially those with diverse populations such as University of Maryland Baltimore City, Morgan State University, and Coppin State University, fostering collaboration and economic growth in the city and beyond. Over five years, this grant will impact 150 JHU teams and to a minimum 45 non-JHU teams, each comprised of three team members, for a total of at least 585 participants.

    into entrepreneurship. Lack of exposure to STEM professionals and limited access
    to information regarding entrepreneurship may limit African American students?
    opportunities to participate in research based academic entrepreneurship. Situating
    an I-Corps Site within the JSU institutional contributes to greater understanding
    of the best practices for overcoming the obstacles that hinder people of color
    and women in STEM from participating in innovation and commercialization activities.\n\nThrough
    teaching and learning activities for faculty and students in STEM, and by actively
    engaging faculty and students of color in academic entrepreneurship, start-up,
    and commercialization training and customer discovery, the JSU Entrepreneurship
    Center/I-Corps Site plays a major role in broadening the participation of underrepresented
    populations in STEM related entrepreneurial activities. The increased participation
    of faculty of color impacts society and the community in particular by bringing
    to market the products, process, services, and/or tools that are the result of
    research from a diverse pool of scholars and thinkers. The pairing of underrepresented

  title: 'I-Corps Sites:  Expanding the Innovation Ecosystem at Washington State University'
- abstractText: "NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established
    at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams
    to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure,
    advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable
    groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
    Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally
    and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs
    and investors.\n\nThis Site builds on activities at this institution during the
    past 5-6 years during which the University of Washington (UW) developed an ecosystem
    for technology entrepreneurship that provides integrated resources and also uses
    the business-model canvas as part of the planning around each commercialization
    opportunity. \n\nUW will apply I-Corps Site funding to qualified teams for the
    purpose of initiating and developing specific customer relationships. They will
    solicit Site teams from three overlapping pipelines of emerging start-ups at the
    UW: UW Center for Commercialization; the Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship; and
    the Clean Energy Initiative, with overlapping pipelines of technology start-ups
    and of student-led start-ups. With a Site award, UW addresses customer development
    within the I-Corps framework. \n\nBroader Impacts:\nUW has been actively participating
    in state-level and regional entrepreneurial strategies for the past six years.
    Their involvement in the I-Corps national network expands their coherent effort
    to execute a national strategy. Also, to help drive the regional innovation economy
    around Seattle and the Puget Sound, UW has developed its own ecosystem for technology
    entrepreneurship. An I-Corps Site award will expand participant?s entrepreneurial
    experience, especially for students, by emphasizing the importance of early and
    frequent interactions with potential customers. This would directly improve the
    quality and momentum of the start-ups in UW's pipeline, which translates into
    healthier company starts in Washington State."

- abstractText: "This is a proposal to create an I-Corps Site at the University of
    Connecticut (UConn).\n\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities
    established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple,
    local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites
    provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training

    or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \n\nI-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation
    locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors,
    researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe University of Connecticut proposes
    to create Accelerate UConn, an NSF I-Corp Site, to strengthen its existing innovation
    ecosystem with entrepreneurial education, experiential learning and a business
    creation process that is based on the I-Corps model. Accelerate UConn (AU) is
    a joint effort of Technology Acceleration Partners (TAP) ­UConn's technology transfer,
    incubation and commercialization entity -and the Connecticut Center for Entrepreneurship
    and Innovation (CCEI), which is responsible for much of UConn?s internal and external
    entrepreneurial education activities. \n\nAs an NSF I-Corps site, AU will expand
    UConn's community of innovators and entrepreneurs and will aid in the transformation
    of UConn discoveries into products that benefit humanity and add to economic growth.
    \n\nBroader Impacts:\nThe proposed activity may significantly impact the preparedness
    of university talent for roles in technology-based, entrepreneurial enterprises
    and, as such, will be a critical ingredient of the economic success of Connecticut
    and the nation. Connecticut has historically relied on well-established companies
    to support its economy, resulting in a dearth of entrepreneurial talent that has
    lead to a loss of innovative capacity. AU's activities will support the shift
    from dependence on large corporate employers to an entrepreneurially driven economy.
    As more startups begin to flourish as a result of AU's efforts, new jobs will
    be created and the career prospects of  graduates will be strengthened. \n\nOn
    the national level, there is valid concern that losing our standing as the global
    leader in technology will result in economic contraction. AU?s activities may
    counter this trend by teaching university researchers to think beyond traditional
    academic boundaries, thus enabling this group of individuals to remain in science
    by becoming drivers of innovation within technology-based, entrepreneurial companies,
    which they help to create."

    center (AIME) at The University of Alabama expands their existing proof-of-concept
    center into an I-Corps Site, to accelerate the commercialization of marketable
    ideas at The University of Alabama. The Site nurtures science, technology, engineering
    and mathematics (STEM) faculty and students, with projects originating from student
    work, research, institutional or industrial projects, and creates a local innovation
    ecosystem that contributes to a larger, national network of mentors, researchers,
    entrepreneurs and investors. \n\nThe University of Alabama Site provides infrastructure,
    advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable
    groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
    Team applicants. Working with their regional I-Corps Node at the Georgia Institute
    of Technology, The University of Alabama Site will improve and expand AIME's current
    innovation curriculum and training programs. Site funding offers entrepreneurial
    teams the opportunity to increase their chance of commercial success through funds
    for the acquisition of modest amounts of equipment or materials needed to fabricate
    prototypes, travel expenses to consult with potential clients or experts, or other
    resources needed to directly advance the goals of transitioning a team's project
    into the marketplace. In addition, the Site offers access to resources and training
    to the sponsored entrepreneurial teams in order to nurture UA faculty, staff and
    students to transition their innovative technologies into the marketplace. \n\nBroader
    Impacts:\nThe direct impact is to educate the UA community in technology commercialization,
    transition teams to becoming NSF I-Corps trained teams and form start-up companies.
    The potential long term impact is to provide them with the education and skills
    that will position them to become part of the knowledgeable, creative workforce
    that will help the US maintain leadership in critical areas of science, technology,
    engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  The University of Alabama Site provides
    a formal structure to nurture entrepreneurial teams and guide the output of scientific
    discoveries closer to the development of technologies, products, and processes
    that benefit society. AIME has consistently recruited underrepresented STEM students
    and the Site will leverage the university's STEM Path to the MBA program and will
    encourage and advance minority participation in STEM-based entrepreneurial activities.
    In addition to impacting the university community, this Site program will enhance
    networking and partnerships through the involvement of AIME's mentors, who provide
    a network in their specific industries. Through providing a database of contacts,
    providing interaction with experts and providing top notch seminars, the University
    of Alabama Site has the opportunity to increase public participation in STEM activities
    by providing modest funds for prototypes and exploration into product-market fit,
    which increases the chance of commercial success. The University of Alabama Site
    has the opportunity to enhance the value of new ventures and make them better-positioned
    to hire employees and create transformative products and services for the benefit
    of society."

    likely to impact the ecosystem of the georgraphical region where this institution
    is located. In the past, Delaware benefitted from the presence of several large,
    hi-tech employers But, lingering effects from the economic downturn reduced the
    state's social and economic wellbeing. Consequently, an increase in startup activity,
    and the associated creation of new jobs, will serve to improve the economic wellbeing
    of Delaware and the surrounding region.  Broader impacts resulting from participation
    in the I-Corps Program will also include improved educational outcomes and competitiveness
    for STEM students, and stronger partnerships between academia and industry. The
    possibility of receiving funding and joining an I-Corps team may incentivize STEM
    students to learn about innovation and entrepreneurship by participating in existing
    training opportunities, thereby improving their educational outcomes and competitiveness.
    Stronger partnerships between academia and industry will result from interactions
    between I-Corps team members and prospective industry customers as well as the
    formation of I-Corps teams that will attempt to commercialize industry technology."

    project consists of a national Summit for Broadening Participation (BP) and inclusiveness
    within the academic community that comprises the NSF National Innovation Network
    (NIN). This BP Summit initiative is motivated by several statistics: while Blacks
    comprise over 14% of the workforce in all private industries in the United States,
    they account for only 7.4% of the high-tech workforce, and people of color represent
    only 8% of US innovators. By contrast, whites account for nearly 64% of the workforce
    in all private U.S. industries, but over 68% of the high-tech workforce. Hispanic
    workers are also underrepresented, comprising just under 14% of jobs in all private
    U.S. industries, but less than 8% in high-tech industries, and women represent
    only 12% of US Innovators. \n\nThe BP Summit for inclusiveness in innovation and
    entrepreneurship has several key objectives: provide participants with an understanding
    of how academic institutions and individuals can boot-strap themselves into the
    mainstream sphere of commercialization, particularly through the I-Corps programs;
    provide insights into the impacts that programs like I-Corps have had on individuals
    and institutions; connect champions at MSIs with existing I-Corps Nodes and Sites
    personnel; highlight winning strategies employed by individuals and institutions
    and outcomes of successful innovations; increase the participation of under-represented
    groups in I-Corps training at the local, regional, and national levels, both at
    the team and instructor levels; provide opportunities for networking and collaborations
    between attendees.\n\nThe Summit brings together representatives of: Historically
    Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs),
    Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI), I-Corps Node and Site personnel, researchers
    in the fields of inclusiveness and entrepreneurship, and, leadership from organizations
    serving the target population who can help innovation and entrepreneurship to
    their members such as the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society
    of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), the Society of Women Engineers (SWE),

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Southwest I-Corps Node (SWICORPS) project will derive from its extensive reach and its carefully structured programming and research.  SWICORPS is the largest Node in the program, covering five states from Oklahoma to the Texas-Mexico border (over 800 miles), and from New Mexico to Louisiana (over 1,000 miles). SWICORPS includes four Research 1 level institutions and will leverage its access to almost 500 degree-granting institutions to build entrepreneurship capacity in the region. SWICORPS will introduce faculty and students throughout the region to the I-Corps entrepreneurial curricula, ultimately increasing the economic impact of their research. The activities of the node will build a cadre of STEM researchers and students with an entrepreneurial mindset and appropriate training to exploit their research discoveries in the marketplace. With nearly half a million students enrolled in Minority Serving Institutions in Texas alone, SWICORPS will focus efforts and outreach to the regions most underserved areas to grow the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

    This I-Corps Node project provides training and infrastructure to share the Lean Launchpad I-Corps curriculum with affiliates across a vast and diverse region. It will continue to expand to reach new trainers and impact early-stage startups, including those from Sites located in the region. These activities will help to build a regional critical mass of technology-based companies. The I-Corps Node will raise awareness of the value of entrepreneurship and business skills among science and engineering faculty, researchers, and students through its customized regional programs and outreach initiatives. This Node will build on best practices to develop an effective mentor network and aid teams in identification of mentors for national program training. The partner schools will contribute to the National Innovation Network for the development of new curricula and advanced tools. The node will exploit metrics and outcomes from its regional activities to better understand the entrepreneurial mindset, and to determine which tools best serve entrepreneurs during and after the customer discovery process. Southwest I-Corps Node's recruitment of strong national teams will continue to increase the impact of federally funded research, and will contribute to innovation, job creation, and economic growth, both in the region and throughout the country.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps Project is to conduct customer discovery interviews to identify initial customers that can support a universal medication autoinjector platform technology that can democratize accessibility to medications.  A direct ampule autoinjector system can leverage the existing global medical infrastructure of the ampule-based medication cartridge while expanding accessibility of medications.  From a cost effectiveness and cost minimization perspective, an equally safe and efficacious drug delivery platform technology will require complex advancements in the scientific and technological understanding of injection systems that can deliver a consistent dose of medication free of particulate contamination, air bubbles, and is also user intuitive with little to no technical training.  The potential societal impact of this technology can save many lives since having wider access to this technology can prevent death or disability that can arise if patients undergoing medical situations are not treated quickly.  This platform technology can also protect emergency responders, civilians and military personnel exposed to biological or chemical threats.  The potential commercial impact of the project can disrupt the multi-billion-dollar health care market, democratize health care access, while being capable of expanding into global markets.

    This I-Corps project will further the development and commercialization of direct ampule-based autoinjector technology through customer discovery.  Technical results of the feasibility of the technology under development have been proven through the development of a proof of concept that can consistently deliver a volume of medication.  These results have been further refined to the publication of a patent undergoing review.  The NSF sponsored customer discovery program will help the team develop the framework for conducting customer discovery interviews in a structured format while incorporating interview responses and data into a commercialization strategy for product to market execution.  The intellectual merits of the proposed activity will help the team identify how current needs are being addressed regarding the administration of medications while more importantly identifying if those needs are truly met and or if there are other needs that can be met which currently are not met.  The I-Corps customer discovery training program can help the project team identify stakeholders, key opinion leaders and develop a customer segmentation profile that can more accurately identify actual customers and payers in the health care medical device ecosystem while seeking avenues for collaboration in the healthcare industry.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable personalized monitoring of sudden cardiac events and heart arrhythmia by combining a wearable device and cloud computing. The project will utilize a patented cloud-connected ring sensor for long-term on-demand Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Current ECG monitoring is a $4 billion dollar market. However no existing product can provide on-demand multi-lead ECG signals over long periods (over one month). Every year over 380,000 Americans die from heart attacks, of which one third happen outside a hospital, motivating a solution to a personalized cardiac monitoring device which can provide actionable diagnosis on-demand and is connected with physicians for quick intervention. This project will potentially enable a first-in-kind ring ECG sensor to serve this unmet need. This I-Corps project will support extensive customer discovery with cardiac patients, healthcare workers, cardiologists, nurses, and telemedicine companies.  In addition, through the NSF I-Corps Team program, two engineering doctoral students will learn important entrepreneurial skills such as the lean start-up model, go through an intensive and rigorous customer discovery process, and network with potential investors and partners.

    This I-Corps project integrates wearable devices with cloud computing to enable personalized cardiac monitoring on-demand. The intellectual merit of the project stems from the innovation of flexible electronics based miniature ECG sensors and cloud-based informatics system. By integrating wearable ECG sensors and cloud computing, on-demand cardiac monitoring information can be shared with cardiologists and emergency physicians. A smartphone can be used to receive physician-suggested actions for early intervention. During this I-Corps project, the team will explore the market potential for cloud-based wearable biosensors at point-of-care settings for cardiac applications where long term on-demand monitoring is important. The project will involve an extensive customer discovery process with potential stakeholders, business model generation and potential partner identification.   More broadly, this platform technology is also applicable to other wearable devices and chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, depression and dementia.

    by the campus-wide Carnegie Mellon Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship
    (CIE), is to implement a systematic and replicable agile startup methodology,
    focused on customer discovery and product adaptation. \n\nThe CMU I-Corps Site
    leverages Carnegie Mellon's strengths and past successes in fusing technology
    with entrepreneurship. Their Site utilizes CMU's network of internal and external
    contacts to train entrepreneurial faculty and student teams working in STEM fields.
    CMU's curricular model is based on the i6 Agile Innovation System and is consistent
    with the I-Corps Curriculum. It includes four elements: workshops, mentoring,
    funding for projects and customer discovery, and incubator space.\n\nThe objectives
    of the CMU Site are to: \n1) capitalize on CMU's culture of innovation by expanding
    programs to nurture entrepreneurial ventures and transition university research
    to the market; \n2) train individuals to understand basic motivations, processes,
    practices, and challenges of innovation and entrepreneurship;\n3) hone individuals'
    entrepreneurial practices and skills; \n4) collaborate with industry, entrepreneurs,
    and the business community in the region and nation. \n\nThe CMU program will
    recruit teams from: existing entrepreneurial activities, course projects, college
    liaisons, and an open call. Underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged
    to apply. Teams will be encouraged to avail themselves of enrichment opportunities
    such as funding avenues, venture competitions, and business events. Each team
    will have an Entrepreneurial Lead, an Academic Lead, and a Mentor.  \n\nThe assessment
    plan focuses on ascertaining the most effective components of an agile university
    entrepreneurship training program. Teams' milestones and customer contacts will
    be tracked. Formative assessment using tools such as pre-, mid-, and post-program
    surveys will inform the CMU program evolution.\n\nOf particular merit is this
    proposed Site's agile and adaptable customer-based training program, components
    of which have been shown to be successful in programs such as the i6 Agile Innovation
    System and the I-Corps Curriculum/Lean Launch Pad. Combining these components
    -- and then distilling through assessment and evaluation which of them are especially
    effective at spurring creativity, resourcefulness, independence, and connectivity
    -- will further entrepreneurial knowledge and education. The program will also
    teach entrepreneurial students and faculty how to create their own ecosystem by
    engaging in customer discovery and network building. \n\nThe CMU I-Corps Site
    plans to move university research out of the lab more efficiently and effectively.
    Expediting the movement of academic innovation to the commercial sector allows
    new, often government-funded, university discoveries and inventions to reach the
    public sector earlier spawning new endeavors and economic growth. All sectors
    of society and areas of inquiry -- healthcare, energy, sustainability, global
    communication, for example, can see benefits. In addition, making earlier decisions
    about viability of commercial outcomes is beneficial as it can more effectively
    utilize critical resources --time, energy, talent, and funds. In addition, a successful
    Site will likely impact the Pittsburgh, Steel Valley, and Allegheny Valley communities."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the ability to provide an easily accessible and reliable national sewer data inventory that will assist municipal utility districts in developing effective and proactive maintenance and rehabilitation plans, hence reducing the overall maintenance costs of sewer systems as well as avoiding costly repairs due to pipe failures. Moreover, if the technology is successfully commercialized, sewer officials such as National Association of Sewer Service Companies (NASSCO) will better understand the current and trend of sewer systems condition nation-wide; as such, they will have proven justification to secure adequate federal funding for sewer system improvements. This technology will support the nation's agenda of improving the condition of the aging and deteriorating sewer infrastructure, which will promote societal wellbeing and support the sustainable development of the society. In addition, it has been expected that the availability of national sewer inventory will help the industry to find new uses of sewer data and new collaborations. The participation in the NSF I-Corps program affords graduate students a great opportunity to cultivate their skills in innovation and entrepreneurship, which may lead to the creation of start-up companies and more job opportunities.

    This I-Corps project addresses common concerns -- data availability and data quality -- raised by sewer industry stakeholders. Understanding the current condition and deterioration mechanism of sewer pipe networks is a critical step in improving national wastewater systems, which requires easily accessible and reliable data. Although sewer inspection data have been collected by various utility districts across the country for many years, the data is not in a usable and uniform format for asset management purposes. This technology provides a visual tool to evaluate and report data quality issues and an innovative algorithm to resolve these issues. The preliminary results show that, by applying the proposed quality assurance algorithm to six datasets obtained by the team, the percentage of good quality inspection data increased from 50%-75% (pre-process) to 95% (post-process). More importantly, the proposed technology includes a comprehensive, uniform, and quality-assured national sewer inventory that documents the historical and current conditions of sewer pipelines. Through the regional NSF I-Corps site program, it was concluded that there is a tremendous need for the proposed technology among utilities and contractors because of the time and cost savings that can be realized in inspection processes and rehabilitation plans.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project (NSF Lineage: Award Number 1644664) is borne from the development of a customizable symptom management tool to support women experiencing menopause. The negative perception of menopause causes symptom embarrassment which leads to deficiencies in health literacy and inefficient symptom management.  This project's technology, a wearable-app system, addresses this inefficiency by providing the means to inform and support women throughout menopause. The proposed I-Corps program explores commercialization opportunities within the project's initial application focus of menopause symptom management and also investigates the potential of applications in the cancer symptom management and data sales markets. With respect to the latter, the prospective technology will gather an abundance of data that may be used to streamline biotechnology and pharmaceutical product development. Through adoption of this technology, women will be able to better communicate their symptoms to a more aware and understanding society. This opens the door to future innovations in additional areas of healthcare that are traditionally not openly discussed.

    This I-Corps project is based on the premise that leveraging personal mobile devices and user data may create disruptive innovation in the healthcare space. The project's technology utilizes multiple sensors to collect personalized data which is used to provide the user with multiple ways to optimize management of her menopause symptoms, with the goal of minimizing their negative impact on her daily routine. Progress on the project to date includes development of an alpha prototype that has been used to test the feasibility of both hardware and software components. Current areas of focus include optimization of the physical design and data acquisition capability. The I-Corps process will allow us to improve our understanding of our customers? unmet needs and the ability of our technology to address them. This will guide the development of our technology, including optimization for manufacturing and feature enhancement, to address needs found in customer discovery and accelerate introduction of a useful product to market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project supports improving the efficiency of inventory and warehouse management operations with a cost-affordable technology innovation capable of monitoring goods in real-time without the need for static communications infrastructure. The project promises to enhance such operations through the extraction of information from the collected data and the provision of time-critical insights at a fraction of the costs of current commercial tools. The monitoring innovation will potentially become the first solution in the market capable of continuously monitoring goods in outdoor environments. In addition, the monitoring innovation will potentially become the first cost-affordable monitoring solution for low-value goods. The innovation promises a primary impact in the sectors of defense and construction. In reality, though, it offers the potential to positively impact the cost and efficiency of complex inventory and warehouse management operations across US industry sectors. This I-Corps team will cross-pollinate discovery and innovation across the broad spectrum of implementation scenarios by addressing the existing latent inefficiencies in such operations.

    This I-Corps project explores the market potential of the real-time monitoring, predictive, and inexpensive innovation in support of inventory and warehouse management operations. A realistic real-time monitoring solution without the need for static communications infrastructure is a technically complex endeavor beyond the capabilities of commercial tracking and monitoring tools. The proposed innovation optimizes operations and information flows, and the response to upstream (push) and downstream (pull) processes and overall system performance. As large datasets are fused the artificial intelligence aspect of the innovation automatically identifies inefficiencies and bottlenecks, and reassesses forecasts and system decisions that account for latest events, data uncertainties, and multiple local optima. This I-Corps team plans to investigate the market potential of the innovation, validate customer needs and how the innovation can alleviate such needs, and discern sustainable business models.

    for U.S. students at the overlap of sustainability, power systems and signal processing
    with the aim of improving efficiency in PV power generation. Algorithms for shading
    prediction and fault optimization will advance the state of the art in remote
    solar array management.  Training students in machine learning, vision and data
    processing for energy systems is unique and requires an integrative approach.
    \ IRES participants will be immersed in producing and understanding solar analytics
    and creating algorithms and software to control solar arrays. The IRES program
    will engage faculty researchers from the Arizona State University SenSIP center
    and from the University of Cyprus KIOS Center in solar energy research. Programs
    and workshops will be established so that IRES participants are trained in machine
    learning for energy systems and present their research results in international
    settings. Weekly presentations at the international site and guidance by international
    mentors will enrich the cohort research experience. Embedding students in the
    KIOS center research labs funded by large European Union (EU) grants will provide
    knowledge on EU and international research practices, energy standards and policies.
    Students will spend six summer weeks at the University of Cyprus KIOS center to
    improve their research skills and elevate their cultural competencies.  This international
    research endeavor will energize students to innovate and disseminate results globally.
    \n\n Solar energy or photovoltaic (PV) arrays encounter loss of efficiency under
    conditions of shading, panel faults and temperature variations.  In fact, shading,
    weather patterns, soiling, and temperature reduce power output considerably. For
    example, a malfunction of one panel will cause an entire PV string to fail.  To
    minimize inefficiencies, individual panel current-voltage (I-V) measurements,
    weather information, and imaging data are essential. Controlling the power output
    is possible through solar panel matrix switching and optimization (i.e., changing
    certain array connections from series to parallel using actuators). Matrix switching
    using programmable relays allows for different interconnection options. The research
    goal is to optimize PV array systems by: a) exploiting the measured I-V patterns
    to detect faults using machine learning, b) employing advanced imaging and vision
    techniques to predict shading, c)  using temperature, irradiance  and weather
    data to elevate PV efficiency, and d) include smart grid interfaces.  This collaborative
    IRES project between Arizona State University and University of Cyprus will engage
    students in the following research problems: a) How do we use imaging to detect
    cloud movement, predict shading and elevate efficiency? b) How can the array connections
    be reconfigured based on imaging, weather, and I-V data to elevate efficiency?
    c) How can we detect and classify panel faults in real time using machine learning
    and other algorithms? d) How do we extend these solar monitoring and control concepts
    from utility-scale solar farms to house rooftop systems?\n\nThis award reflects

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project can
    be significant as it can provide pathways for commercialization of a breakthrough
    research for continuous miniaturization of computer chips. For the digital electronics
    in everyday use, smaller and better chips imply lesser cost, higher performance,
    and more features. As traditional way of IC scaling reaches unsurmountable barriers
    at sub-10nm technology nodes, the proposed technology provides new directions
    for scaling through innovations in several layers from fundamental physical components,
    computing model, to circuits and integration. In addition, the technology promises
    denser, faster and more power efficient computing with unique capabilities for
    fault-tolerant and secure hardware through inherent physical capabilities and
    design choices. The technology, coupled with Intellectual Property (IP) development
    strategy based fabless commercialization approach is proposed for market penetration
    and growth at a fast turn-around time.  The product will be beneficial for a wide
    range of customers from microprocessor producers to consumer electronics manufacturers
    and be particularly attractive for defense entities. This I-corps teams project
    will allow customer discovery, business model generation and evaluation of commercialization
    potentials for successful SBIR/STTR proposals, and can ultimately lead to the
    transition of lab research to product. It will have a lasting impact on the participants.
    \n \nThis I-Corps project seeks commercialization potential of a novel computing
    technology that relies on deterministic interference between adjacent nanoscale
    interconnects (Crosstalk) for logic computing. The proposed approach departs from
    current device switching dependent computing paradigm and relaxes difficult device
    scaling requirements. The scalability in Crosstalk fabric is determined primarily
    by circuit scheme, integration and the ability to pattern smaller metal nano-lines
    and deposit dielectrics in between them, which can be done by utilizing existing
    EDA and manufacturing methods. The proposed computing approach is functionally
    complete, and provides huge opportunities for logic reduction; by having more
    than 2 inputs couple to a single output and by varying their respective coupling
    capacitances, a logic implementation (e.g., Carry logic for Addition) that would
    typically require more than 15 transistors in CMOS, can be done by just 5 transistors.
    The benchmarking of a 4-bit adder showed over 5x density benefits vs. CMOS at
    16nm. Another distinct feature of Crosstalk technology is the run-time reconfigurability
    that allows different functionalities to be embedded in the same circuit, which
    can be transformative for fault tolerance (i.e., if a portion of CPU is damaged,
    the functioning portion can be configured to do both tasks), and cybersecurity.\n\nThis

    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    that the proposed technology provides a much-needed solution to the current problems
    in electrosurgery that is widely used in many medical specialties such as neurological
    surgery. Electrosurgery is fast and requires short post-surgery recovery time;
    however, major problems such as collateral nerve damage and seal failure still
    exist, sometimes with fatal consequences. The proposed technology helps eliminate
    those problems by monitoring the electrosurgical process with an acoustic signal.
    It will enable an assistive device for surgeons to make precise decisions that
    will ensure the surgical quality. It will reduce surgeon fatigue, time in the
    operating room, and healthcare cost, while improving the overall patient experience.
    This project allows extensive customer discovery and market analysis, from which
    commercial products will be developed to satisfy the needs of patients, surgeons,
    and hospitals. With the projected $5.17B global market for electrosurgical equipment
    by 2021, the proposed technology will have a significant commercial potential.
    The monitoring methodology applied to this project brings advances to the field
    of precision surgery with engineering principles. \n\nThis I-Corps project focuses
    on developing a real-time acoustic signal monitoring system for quality assurance
    of the electrosurgical process. First, sound signals captured during the surgery
    is correlated to the water boiling and protein denaturing process in heated tissue.
    Then, a decision-making algorithm is developed based on the signal strength and
    number of bubble bursting events. Previous research on the electrosurgical process
    has provided fundamental understanding and suggested that the acoustic monitoring
    method is dramatically better than existing ones. In the previous study, experiments
    was conducted with ex-vivo porcine tissue and the feasibility of the proposed
    technology using a low-profile sensor was demonstrated. This I-Corps award will
    provide opportunities to conduct customer interviews for technology refinement.
    A set of functional requirements for product development will be identified to
    support commercialization of the proposed technology.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    to prevent and treat obesity and its related diseases using adipose stromal stem
    cell (ASC)-targeted nanoparticle (NP)-based drug delivery technology. Obesity
    is a major public health problem in the US and worldwide. More than one third
    of US adults are obese, and more than two thirds are either overweight or obese.
    Obesity is a major risk factor for developing heart disease, stroke, diabetes,
    fatty liver diseases and other metabolic disorders. The estimated yearly medical
    care costs of obesity are more than $145 billion in the US. Currently available
    anti-obesity medical therapies have many severe issues, hence, better approaches
    to combat obesity are greatly needed. The ASC-targeted NP-based delivery technology
    is to deliver bioactive agents/drugs to ASCs in subcutaneous adipose tissue, inducing
    excessive glucose and fat burn off, thus combating obesity and its related complications
    with high efficacy and minimum side effects.  Our technology can improve human
    health and the quality of life while dramatically reducing medical care costs,
    ultimately lessening the negative societal and economic impact of obesity. In
    addition, a doctoral student will gain intensive and rigorous training and experience
    in innovation and entrepreneurship. \n\nThis I-Corps project will explore the
    market potential of a technology involving the use of ASC-targeted NP-based device
    for the prevention and treatment of obesity with high efficacy and low side effects.
    ASCs are stem cells found in the adipose tissues. ASCs can be differentiated into
    many different types of cells that aid in tissue repair, regenerative medicine,
    obesity and other disease therapy. We aim to induce ASCs differentiation into
    beige adipocytes in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue for combating obesity.
    Different from fat-storage white adipocytes, beige adipocytes burn excessive fat
    and glucose. ASC-targeted NP-based device can deliver bioactive agents/drugs to
    subcutaneous ASCs and subsequently induce them differentiation into beige adipocytes,
    resulting in body weight and fat loss and improved metabolic health. This local
    (transdermal device) and targeted (ASC-targeted NPs) delivery technology bypasses
    the liver and other tissues, thus minimizing administration frequency, enhancing
    compliance, and most importantly, maximizing overall treatment efficacy while
    decreasing side effects. This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the market opportunity
    of the FatBurningNanoTM technology and help establish product-market fit through
    upcoming customer interviews. The feedback from these activities will facilitate
    product development, and its ultimate commercialization.\n\nThis award reflects

    be found in civil engineering infrastructure development projects where construction
    is undertaken in areas affected by expansive soils, i.e. soils that shrink and
    swell in response to changes soil moisture level.  Such shrink/swell activity
    in foundation soils is a leading cause of structural damage to roadways and other
    infrastructure systems built upon them. In the United States Texas, Colorado,
    Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota
    are among the states with major problems due to presence of expansive soil. Expansive
    soils have reportedly caused problems in other parts of the world as well. Traditionally,
    lime and Portland cement have been used to stabilize such expansive soils. However,
    these traditional stabilizers cannot be used in all soil conditions. In such situations,
    the only viable solution is to remove the native soil and replace it with better
    quality materials. The proposed I-Corps technology involves a sustainable soil
    stabilizer that overcomes many of the limitations found in the traditional stabilizers.
    \ It provides a more economical alternative in projects where remove-and-replace
    strategy is currently used.  \n\nThis I-Corps project explores opportunities for
    commercialization of a novel soil stabilizer which uses an inorganic compound
    known as geopolymer as the key ingredient. Geopolymers are synthesized using abundantly
    available natural materials and/or industrial by-products such as fly ash and
    ground blast furnace slag. Unlike traditional soil stabilizers (viz. hydrated
    lime and Portland cement) which require vast amounts of energy during production,
    geopolymers are synthesized at or near ambient temperatures. Accordingly, the
    new stabilizer represents a more sustainable alternative to traditional soil stabilizers.
    \ Extensive laboratory testing and microstructural studies conducted during the
    product development phase demonstrate that the new stabilizer can achieve more
    than 90% reduction in shrink/swell potential.  The experimental data also confirm
    that the geopolymer-based stabilizer can be used effectively to overcome a number
    of significant limitations that exist in the traditional stabilizers, such as
    inability to treat sulfate-bearing soils. Traditional lime stabilization requires
    a waiting period of 4-7 days for the stabilizing reactions to take place; this
    causes interruption in work flow and delay in construction.  In such situations,
    the new stabilizer can be used to treat the native soil and improve its engineering
    properties and thus eliminate need for expensive remove-and-replace operations.\n\nThis

    from a more cost-effective thin film technology to harvest sunlight and convert
    into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. The solar energy market is dominated
    by the crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin film solar panels.
    The CdTe thin-film panels require high energy consumption during manufacturing,
    and are constrained by the toxicity of Cd and limited earth storage of Te.  The
    project will explore the commercial opportunities of manufacturing antimony chalcogenides
    thin-film solar panel with lower cost, higher efficiency, and less energy consumption
    for residential, commercial and utility level application. The cost of the traditional
    thin-film solar panel could be significantly reduced by utilizing the knowledge
    of increasing the thin film solar cell efficiency and developing a cost-effective
    earth abundant antimony chalcogenide source. The reduced solar energy cost will
    further boost the application of solar energy in the US and provide alternative

    is to discover which customer segment would value the photovoltaic efficiency
    of the Sb2Se3 thin film solar cells such that the commercialization potential

    structure (non-cubic structure), which are opposite to the traditional cubic chalcogenides
    thin film solar cells (i.e., CdTe, CuInGaSe).  These orthorhombic materials exhibit
    unique crystal structure which consists of quasi-one-dimensional ribbons weakly
    bonded by van der Waals forces, leading it to be a promising absorber material
    for photovoltaic application due to its properties of the high absorption coefficient,
    approximately 1.1 eV bandgap optimal for single junction solar cells. Sb2Se3,
    an earth-abundant constituent, has low toxicity and uses a low energy manufacture
    process. These above factors make Sb2Se3 to be a promising candidate to replace
    Cd, Ga/In in the commercial thin-film solar modules. These Sb2Se3 can be compatible

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to improve our understanding of the market forces that drive the need/use of antimicrobial materials. With ~1.7 million healthcare-associated infections causing upwards of 99,000 deaths annually in the United States, and adding about $30-45 billion to health care costs every year, the potential societal impact stemming from this proposed activity include a better understanding of the market forces that govern the need/use of antimicrobial materials. Understanding such forces will be important for the creation of the next generation of antimicrobial materials, and will impact the fields of materials and polymer science, textile engineering, packaging, and infectious disease (microbiology, virology) by providing performance guidelines in terms of material characteristics, physical properties, and antimicrobial efficacy. Food processing, packaging and service industries, waste water treatment, daycare facilities, and personal households are other potential areas that will benefit from this project. As such, given the potential commercial applications of platform antimicrobial technologies, narrowing the number of possible products and identifying a few key markets will be important for their commercialization, and this effort will be to better define the most viable products from which to commercialize platform antimicrobial technologies.

    This I-Corps project aims to help the research team arrive at a go/no-go decision on whether to pursue commercialization of an anti-infective material: comprised of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) into which are embedded photosensitizers (PS, chemical compounds that react with light and emit biocidal oxygen), this photoactive material, termed NFC-PS, is capable of the rapid, efficient, and low-cost sterilization of a wide range of infective agents, including drug-resistant bacteria and viruses, making it a platform technology from which to develop self-sterilizing materials. The intellectual merits of the proposed voice-of-customer research will establish the market-driven need for antimicrobial materials, including: i) to identify what customers and/or potential licensees would need in terms of anti-infective material properties (e.g. longevity, chemical resistance, integration into existing products, maximum cost or price points, EPA and/or FDA regulatory approvals); ii) to help identify potential products that could be improved by adding antimicrobial characteristics to them; and iii) to complete a business model canvas for the NFC-PS technology. Initial product ideation based upon the NFC-PS platform technology will be narrowed to 1-2 main products from a much broader number of market categories, and will be used to identify what prototype(s) should be developed along the path to commercialization.

    The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to investigate the challenges that data scientists face in debugging big data analytics today and to investigate the commercial potential of research work on interactive and automated debugging of big data analytics. Big data analytics is increasingly important in the 21st century, where our daily lives leave behind a detailed digital record. Decision-makers of all kinds, from companies to government agencies, would like to base their actions on data. If successful, this project will offer a unique opportunity to discover software development tooling needs for big data systems and to identify innovative software tooling products that sit across the software stack from the user-facing API all the way down to the systems infrastructure.

    This I-Corps project builds on early research work on real-time debugging primitives and tool-assisted fault-localization services for big data processing applications written in modern data intensive scalable computing (DISC) systems like Apache Spark. Designing debugging primitives for DISC requires re-thinking the traditional step-through debugging primitives as provided by tools such as gdb. For example, a breakpoint feature that simply pauses the entire computation would waste large amounts of computational resources and prevent correct tasks from completing, reducing overall throughput. Further, requiring the user to inspect the millions of intermediate records produced during execution is clearly infeasible. When a failure or incorrect result is generated (e.g., outlier), pinpointing the root cause is extremely time-consuming and expensive due to massive scale of data. In short, the intellectual merit of this I-Corps project is to investigate how users can benefit from expressive debugging primitives and automated fault localization services when they must leverage for data science and big data analytics capabilities.

    be across multiple industries that can benefit from regular monitoring of changes
    on the Earth's surface. Changes such as droughts, floods, deforestation, urbanization,
    and grain supply (acreage and yields) fluctuations have considerable impact on
    businesses as well as the environment. For example, it is estimated that US lost
    approximately 23 billion dollars due to drought in 2012. This I-Corps project
    will make use of vast amounts of satellite data to provide accurate, timely and
    actionable insights about these changes to customers in various industries such
    as commodity trading, crop insurance, and precision agriculture, pasture management.
    Our ability to track these changes at a global scale will also improve our understanding
    of the impact of climate and human induced changes on various ecosystems. \n\nThis
    I-Corps project uses machine learning algorithms that analyze vast amounts of
    satellite imagery datasets to provide near real time as well as historical information
    about various changes on the Earth's surface. These algorithms were developed
    through various federal research grants which includes three NSF grants. Data
    products created using these algorithms have been validated to improve the state-of-the-art
    in several earth science applications such as forest fire mapping, surface water
    dynamics, palm oil plantation mapping, and crop mapping. The analytics technology
    is more generally applicable to other domains with similar underlying data characteristics.
    The commercial-use prototype will be developed with commodity traders providing
    expert feedback on their most meaningful use-cases.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project on healthcare, quality of life, and the medical device industry is tremendous. The novel technology and advancement of biodegradable metals and biomimetic interfaces will lead to next-generation medical devices and implants that promote tissue healing and eliminate secondary surgeries for implant removal. This will improve quality of life for patients who need medical implants to support bones and tissue damaged by disease or trauma, and reduce overall healthcare costs. The project will build the foundation for commercializing biodegradable metallic implants and devices, which, in turn, will increase the competitiveness of U.S. companies in the medical device industry. The products resulting from this project will reduce pain and complications, eliminate secondary surgeries, and accelerate healing and recovery for patients who need medical implants due to trauma or disease.

    This I-Corps project will advance technology that eliminates the drawbacks of the non-degradable medical alloys on the market today. Magnesium (Mg) based alloys are a novel class of biodegradable metallic materials that have attractive mechanical and biological properties for a wide range of medical implant applications, such as orthopedic, spinal, dental, and craniofacial implants. The key challenge in commercializing Mg-based alloys for medical implant applications lies in controlling the degradation rate. NSF support has contributed to a novel class of biocompatible Mg alloys along with biomimetic surface treatment to provide tunable degradation rates, desirable bioactivity, and excellent mechanical strength for supporting faster healing and regeneration of damaged tissues. This novel solution contains non-toxic natural elements that induce healing and reduce inflammation, departed from traditional alloy design. The I-Corps project will transform this technology to commercially viable products that will benefit the customers in need.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project relates to the developments in precision/personalized medicine, and specifically, to much-needed improvements in accuracy and speed of finding genome variants using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The personalized medicine concepts are based on individual genome variants and the personalized medicine market is expected to reach $178 billion in 2022. The cost advantage of a fast and accurate variant-finding product will be proportional to the number of genomes analyzed by users in this market. There has been a recent exponential increase in the size and scope of whole genome sequencing projects from 10,000 publicly available human genomes in 2016 to the UK 100,000 Genomes Project to even larger, though less-clearly defined, sequencing projects involving 1,000,000 participants proposed in the US (Precision Medicine Initiative, and Million Veteran Program) and China. In a likely and important scenario of sequencing the whole US population in the foreseeable future, the cost saving could be several billion dollars, thus making such efforts more feasible.

    This I-Corps project will enable entrepreneurial education and customer discovery for a software that will be based on a novel comprehensive method of genome variant detection, GROM (Genome Rearrangement Omni-Mapper). GROM boasts lightning-speed runtimes, an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art variant detection pipelines. While drastically reducing computational time, GROM provides superior overall variant detection compared to commonly employed algorithms. These unique advantages over available tools both in speed and precision could make GROM a very desirable application in this field (utilized via either licensing or pay-per-use commercial models). This will require a better understanding of a potential market and customer discovery. The process will include an educational component at I-Corps workshops and a discovery component via meetings and active communication with numerous potential users of the technology in commercial and non-commercial entities. The customer discovery effort may result in developing an appropriate business plan for attracting investments in a potential startup that will perform further development and licensing of the product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the project facilitate the design and operation of electromagnetic telemetry for underground wireless communication in oilfield measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and logging-while-drilling (LWD). The performance of an electromagnetic telemetry system is heavily dependent on electrical properties of the underground formation, as well as the deployment of downhole and surface antennas. Rigorous electromagnetic full wave simulations are critical in design, development, and deployment of an electromagnetic telemetry system for a drilling job. The modeling software package will potentially be the first product on the market with the capability of providing efficient 3D simulations of electromagnetic telemetry systems in complicated underground environments. Besides the oil and gas industry, electromagnetic telemetry can also be used in other important areas such as CO2 sequestration, deep borehole disposal of nuclear waste, and geothermal energy exploration.

    This I-Corps project explores the market potential of a 3D electromagnetic telemetry modeling tool for the oil and gas industry and other areas involving drilling activities. A realistic electromagnetic telemetry system is an extremely multiscale structure, and rigorously modeling such a system is beyond the capabilities of available commercial electromagnetic simulation tools. The proposed product is based on the recent advancement of computational electromagnetics algorithms using 3D integral equations with a novel coated thin wire model to simulate the metallic drill string and borehole environment in layered formation. The product as a modeling software can be several orders more accurate than existing commercial simulation tools for the analysis of electromagnetic telemetry systems. The goal of this I-Corps team is to investigate the market potential of this technology and related product in the oilfield and other relevant applicable areas.

- abstractText: "The Los Angeles economy, the nation's second largest, is anchored
    by the health care, aerospace and defense industries. It is now also home to the
    rapidly growing Silicon Beach technology corridor, which spawns exciting new startups
    in software, digital and interactive media, renewable energy and a plethora of
    others. With one of the largest populations of graduating engineers in the country
    and a large manufacturing base, the Los Angeles region is ideally poised for a
    substantial transformation of its innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. The
    Los Angeles Regional I-Corps Node will help accelerate this transformation, by
    helping to increase the potential for leveraging the region's products and services.
    The University of Southern California led Node, consisting of a partnership between
    the University of Southern California, the University of California Los Angeles,
    and the California Institute of Technology, will improve the region's ecosystem
    by: modeling how to leverage regional strengths to support commercialization nationally;
    studying team and customer-network formation; aligning technology and organizational
    maturity paths; and determining institutional support mechanisms to accelerate
    team coalescence, technology-to-product transformation, and customer acquisition.
    The Node will contribute to the NSF's mission of empowering STEM students, technical
    professionals, researchers and entrepreneurs to actively and effectively translate
    innovative ideas into large-scale commercialization. Annual I-Corps training sessions
    will be created that combine the strength of the partner institutions to offer
    new regional entrepreneurial opportunities and contribute novel resources to the
    I-Corps National Innovation Network (NIN). Two efforts will specifically focus
    on extending the Lean Start-up model to established industries in the Los Angeles
    region. The first will focus on health-care engineering, including a 'Mobile Demo
    Day' that will educate researchers on the convergence of engineering and medicine,
    regulatory hurdles, insurance strategies, medical industry distribution models,
    and related issues. The second will focus on aerospace and defense; offering unparalleled
    access to insight, mentoring, and opportunities to technologists in this area,
    along with strategies that can be used to develop an alignment with large-scale
    system integrators. \n\nThe Node will provide a vibrant research center for commercialization
    processes and outcomes. It will examine founding team formation, the coalescence
    of engineering talent with business skills, and customer and alliance development
    that cultivates relationships with industry incumbents. The research will also
    focus on evaluating and improving entrepreneurial skills in technology maturity
    assessments, understanding the level of technology maturity required for industrial
    adoption, and identifying institutional support mechanism for accelerating commercialization.
    The hypothesis that technology and organizational maturity proceed along independent
    and often unsynchronized timelines will be tested to better understand their interactions
    and identify factors that will increase success. Data from investors, customers,
    and advisors will help provide an awareness of each entrepreneur's stakeholder
    network and recognize correlations involved with both the activity and duration
    of fundraising. In a similar vein, the Node will study the duration to first sales,
    acquisition of government grants, and other milestones in cash generation. These
    factors will be tied to technology development milestones in order to identify
    relationships and key drivers, such as the importance of prospective customers
    and investors in accelerating operational cash flow to the company (i.e., through
    sales, rather than financing). Short-term outcomes will contribute to an understanding
    of the relative importance of various roles and dependencies. Longer-term outcomes
    will contribute to an improvement in the performance of regional teams. The Node's
    website will contribute videos, slide decks, and related materials to the NIN,
    including a 'Needs and Deals' section where local deals that seek specialized
    guidance will be advertised. The website will also post bios and contact information
    for vetted mentors who can assist companies in other regions of the country."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be quicker and more reliable discovery of human burial sites.  The proposed product will help law enforcement officers at municipal, county, state and federal levels discover clandestine human burials thereby aiding in the solution of crimes and enhancing public safety.  Likewise, applications in the military arena would enable discovery of the remains of soldiers missing in action (MIAs), mass graves created during genocide, and other casualties of conflict.  Because the technology of the product has a very general capability, a product based on the same hardware and software may be customized for a variety of commercial applications.  These include: (1) environmental mapping and remediation efforts; (2) cultural resource or heritage management, e.g., by documenting Native American burial grounds; (3) characterization of soil chemistry for agribusiness applications; (4) mapping of sites in archaeology.  All of these applications would create greater demand with resulting commercial and employment opportunities.  Finally, since successful applications will receive media attention, they will provide the opportunity to educate the public about the nature of the science, the value of scientific research to the public good, and technology involved in the product.

    This I-Corps project involves a novel adaptation of existing technologies (spectroscopy, push-probe soil tests) to a new application within forensic science.  The basic concepts of the technologies are well-established.  The product, a robotic mobile device, pushes a probe into the ground at the test locations.  The probe has a window that allows the soil to be illuminated with visible and near infrared light.  Reflected light is collected by fiber optics which carry the light to the surface to be analyzed.  The fraction of each color of light that is absorbed by the soil carries the signature of the chemical content of the soil at each underground location.  These data are then interpreted in terms of the decay products (mainly fatty acids) that indicate the presence of human cadavers.  PI?s earlier research was successful in identifying burials in both controlled mock crime scenes and in real forensic contexts involving disturbed human graves.  The proposed product will provide real-time, reliable interpretation of the data to indicate the presence of a 'hit', an essential part of the value proposition of the product for law enforcement applications.  This marks a very significant improvement over current lab-based analyses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is improving public health systems by predicting, monitoring, and preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases. The broader applications of the proposed software system for analysis of sequencing data will also include tracing cancer development and analyzing its potential to grow, mutate, and resist treatment. The proposed software system will be integrated into laboratories' pipelines for clustering and assembling sequencing reads into complete genomic sequences. The proposed statistical algorithms will analyze the sequencing data more accurately which improves sequencing quality without an increase in sequencing depth thus further reducing sequencing cost.  The proposed software system will attract epidemiological and medical laboratories by more accurate analysis and cost reduction of high-throughput sequencing.

    This I-Corps project deals with growing demand for powerful computational tools for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. Existing software tools can successfully extract different sequences form the same sample but, in many applications, (such as an investigation of outbreaks of infectious disease, cancer research, and genome-wide association studies) it is necessary to distinguish multiple distinct yet closely related genomic sequences. The main obstacle for such studies is a high sequencing error rate and short length of reads produced by high-throughput sequencing technologies. The proposed software system can overcome these obstacles by using statistical algorithms capable of sorting out the sequencing errors delivering complete genomic sequences and accurately identifying point mutations distinguishing closely related sequences.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to significantly reduce the manufacturing cost of semiconductor devices for electronic, photonic, and energy applications. For example, the proposed innovation will bring 40% total cost reduction in light-emitting diodes (LED) chip/die manufacturing, which will provide a faster route for the energy-efficient LEDs to become a dominant lighting source. The innovation will also offer a new device platform for electric power conversion and switching in electric vehicles and smart-grid systems, which means significant benefits in energy saving and greenhouse-gas emission reduction. Hence, the proposed innovation will facilitate the rapid development of next-generation green device technology that can readily be applied to the real-world systems. Furthermore, the flexible material platforms will enable not only mechanically flexible devices for the applications of portable, wearable, and implantable systems, but also new devices with additional functionality for more versatile applications beyond just flexible devices. The new transformative technologies stemming from this project will help U.S. semiconductor manufacturers cope with global challenges and win in the competitive international markets. Therefore, the new platform will contribute to consolidating the U.S. position as a technology and market leader by strategically strengthening the innovation ecosystem of the semiconductor technology.

    This I-Corps project proposes a promising replacement for single-crystalline wafer substrates of semiconductor devices by offering a new mechanically-flexible low-cost substrate. The objective of the project is to deliver commercially available low-cost, high-crystalline-quality, and flexible tape substrates to be employed as a new platform of photonic and electronic semiconductor devices. To accomplish the objective, the team will develop a new substrate consisting of flexible metal tape and a single-crystalline gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor thin film by an invented direct deposition technique. This method also enables the roll-to-roll and large-scale continuous production of high-quality semiconductor materials. The developed GaN/metal tape will to serve as the substrate for the fabrication of LEDs, as an initial target of the innovative technology, and other semiconductor devices. The result will be flexible inorganic LEDs with high efficiency and application versatility at a fraction of the cost of current solid-state lighting sources. The new product, while it is a potentially disruptive technology, has not been deployed in the device market with various products and applications. Therefore, understanding of business development will be critical. The team will perform customer survey and business model development via investigation of value proposition and customer discovery.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to meet the increasing demand of energy consumption and maintain a healthy oil and gas output in the US. Machine vision and automatic data picking are viable approaches to keep up with the data multiplication of seismic surveys. The proposed product is the first one that is aiming at minimizing labor burden in seismic data processing by using a deep neural network with a novel and efficient transfer learning strategy. If successful, the novel deep transfer learning approach will build the foundation for adopting advanced deep neural network technologies by many other industrial applications. In addition to the Oil and Gas industry, the product can also be used in other important areas such as geothermal energy exploration.

    This I-Corps project is to explore the market potential for a product to automatically identify unique patterns embedded in the seismic data. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the theme of a novel deep transfer learning approach, which will ease the training burden of the deep neural network and solve the training data shortage problem by utilizing discriminative unsupervised feature learning to learn high-level representations that are more invariant to variations between the synthetic and real data. The innovativeness of our proposal is that it is aimed to build a reliable system to perform various pattern recognition tasks required by the seismic data processing and be adaptive to different datasets acquired through seismic surveys. This product has the potential to save up to 20% to 50% of the total seismic processing time.

As a potential societal impact, this innovation will enhance the quality of life, by using noninvasive breath sensors for the recognition of human blood glucose level for diabetics. New discoveries will be disseminated through presentations, workshops, partnerships, and potential technology transfer to a start-up company. Industrial collaborators from various companies will help translate this innovation into engineering practice. More than 100 people will be outreached about the innovations in the noninvasive diabetes sensors during the interview process.

    This I-Corps project is to conduct market analysis and customer interviews for commercializing a noninvasive breath biosensor for detecting acetone in exhaled breath for the recognition of human blood glucose level. The molecular imprinted layer improved the selectivity of the sensors by allowing the specific molecule to be exposed into the sensor. The acetone-imprinted sensor shows a wide range of linear relationship with the growth of the acetone concentrations in the range of 0-10 ppm at a sensitivity about 15 &#8486;/ppm. This sensor has the following advantages over the existing diabetes sensors in the market. This sensor has a linear gas response to acetone from <0.9 ppm to 10 ppm, which leads to accurate detection of acetone concentration in breath of patients with diabetes (usually in the range of 1.7 ppm to 3.7 ppm). This sensor demonstrates high stability, improved selectivity, and high sensitivity for acetone from different gas molecules such as moisture, ethanol, etc. This sensor has a small size that can fit in a pocket. Patients with diabetes can conveniently and discretely carry the sensor for real-time detection of acetone in exhaled breath to recognize human blood glucose level and help determine a patient?s insulin needs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable new and improved lateral flow assays (LFAs) through the development of hollow metal nanoparticles as highly sensitive color labels. LFAs are commonly used in environmental monitoring, food safety testing, and point-of-care clinical diagnostics (the most common example is the home pregnancy test). The company?s core technology will improve the performance of the active component in LFA devices, translating to faster and more accurate diagnoses, more timely treatment regimens, and decreased health care costs for patients and providers worldwide. These advantages should prove especially important in resource-constrained settings where access to established laboratories equipped with expensive instrumentation is cost- or time-prohibitive. Thus, the improvement and expansion of rapid, affordable, LFA point-of-care diagnostic platforms represent a critical need and will have broad impacts in public health on a global scale. Moreover, with the growing adoption of nanotechnology throughout industry, there is rapidly increasing demand for intentionally designed nanostructures in a wide range of applications ranging from chemical catalysis to optoelectronics. Securing a foothold in the LFA industry will establish the infrastructure necessary to diversify the company?s product distribution into other industries that could also benefit from the advantages of hollow metal nanoparticles.

    This I-Corps project will explore commercial opportunities for hollow metal nanoparticles. Hollow nanoparticles have substantial advantages over their solid counterparts, including lower mass per particle for reduced material costs, higher surface-area-to-volume ratio for increased loading, and enhanced plasmonic performance. The company?s primary technology is the highly uniform synthesis of hollow metal nanoparticles with predetermined dimensions, surface morphology, optical response, and metal composition. Currently, most conventional LFAs use 30-40 nm solid gold particles, which suffer from low capture rate and low visual contrast. In order to improve the sensitivity of these devices, we have developed more advanced nanostructures which will be captured more effectively and provide greater contrast. Implementing robust customer discovery will enable us to determine the extent of product customization that would be most useful to this target industry. Successfully making this determination and subsequently commercializing the company?s technology would enable LFAs with greater sensitivity, opening the door for platform expansion to previously undetectable diseases and toxins. Moreover, through the company?s immersion into customer discovery and business model canvas principles, we will become experts in the Lean LaunchPad methodology and can then apply this methodology to future target customer segments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project results from its utility for customizing interactive media experiences for diverse users in systems including workplace learning software, streaming media, educational games, and recommendation applications. This is enabled by the project's novel approach to implementing more nuanced user representations in software (online accounts, user profiles, avatars, etc.). Currently, customized systems' responses for specific user representations are expensive to produce and not expressive enough: they often are hardcoded, labor intensive to implement, and fail to support the particular needs of diverse users. In most such systems users' membership in categories (e.g., demographic groups or experts vs. novices) is determined in a top-down fashion, with no possibility for systems to respond to user representations that only partially fit in categories, inhabit multiple categories, or change over time. These deficiencies prevent systems from achieving the nuance of social category membership in everyday life. Finally, a key potential application is building interactive media supporting prosocial skill and knowledge development.

    This I-Corps project will advance knowledge related to modeling user identities in commercial and socially impactful digital media systems. Key to the intellectual merit of the project, the core technology is a computational engine that models identities (using data from profiles, avatars, characters, and accounts) by mathematically computing users' degrees of membership across multiple categories over time. To computationally model category degrees of category membership, the engine computes a closeness value corresponding to the degree to which an actor deviates from a prototypical member of a category, who is defined via a set of features. The degree of membership fluctuates throughout an interactive narrative based on user behaviors. Modeling these scenarios draws upon specific concepts from sociolinguistics, cognitive science, and sociology of classification. They include: category gradience, category dynamics, multiple memberships, inter-category relationships, and prototypes. Along with numerous publications, relevant prior work has been conveyed through invited keynotes and talks at major universities, foundations, and academic venues internationally.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide on-chip optical sensors that enable faster and cheaper production of drugs and chemicals. Pharmaceutical R&D and production rely heavily on chemical analysis to provide insight into the processes at play, however analytical instruments do not follow the latest manufacturing trends towards single-use technologies and smaller batches, or even continuous production. Integrated (on-chip) photonics is an attractive sensing platform thanks to its small form factor, robustness, large multiplexing capability, and tight optical confinement that enhances light-matter interactions. This project will pioneer the large-scale use of integrated photonic sensors starting with chemical sensing, paving the way to other applications. By enabling a better understanding of the reactions at play in manufacturing processes, the proposed technology is poised to impact the pharmaceutical market and help improving public health.

    This I-Corps project aims to develop the first practical implementation of a microchip-scale optical spectrometer. Integrated photonic product remain scarce due to several barriers at the fabrication and packaging levels. This project will mitigate these issues to offer equivalent sensitivity and performance to large benchtop optical spectrometers in a dramatically smaller form factor. This will be realized by combining recent advances in integrated photonic component design, photonic chip architecture, and optical packaging. The proposed sensor will enable novel chemical sensing applications and help with the understanding of processes at play in areas such as cell-based manufacturing and continuous-flow chemical manufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from the potential of our technology to enable untapped energy efficiency, cost, size, and security benefits in the IoT space. In the low-power embedded systems that drive IoT applications, energy efficiency is the primary factor that determines critical system characteristics such as size, weight, cost, reliability, and lifetime. Likewise, security is critical for IoT systems, which are entrusted with nearly all our data ? personal, financial, health-critical, and otherwise. Because of their extreme energy constraints and ubiquitous scale of deployment, these systems have traditionally favored low cost and low power over security, exposing a huge attack surface for information security attacks. Several large-scale exploits have already been reported. By providing automated and low-overhead solutions for security and energy efficiency, our technology has the potential to make a disruptive impact on the IoT space, which is predicted to have a market size of $457 billion by 2020. Additionally, the solutions we provide have the potential to improve information security for the population at large and allow broader deployment of IoT systems that promise to improve quality of life and understanding of the world.

    This I-Corps project is built around technologies that enable aggressive optimization of microprocessors for energy savings, cost reduction, and security. The technologies are based on novel, automated system analysis approaches that identify unused parts of a design and leverage the information to improve system efficiency. The technologies have demonstrated reductions of over an order of magnitude in energy efficiency and area for ultra-low-power microprocessors through a host of application-aware optimization and design techniques. The technologies also allow software programmers to evaluate information flow security for their software on the processor(s) where it will be deployed, enabling software to be certified with security guarantees. Results from our research and initial customer discovery indicate potential to impact the semiconductor industry. Through our technology, design and operating costs for application-specific processors can be significantly reduced, accelerating production of such processors, allowing them to be more widely deployed, and providing traction for new markets such as DIY printed processors. Also, reducing energy for low-power processors that drive the internet of things (IoT) can significantly impact lifetime, reliability, size, and cost of these devices that continue to grow in dominance of the semiconductor market as the IoT revolution continues.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project empowers everyday users to participate in a new healthcare trend called 'self-quantification.'  Self-quantification allows individuals to obtain a deeper understanding of the state of their body, empowering them towards more proactive and precise approaches to optimize their health.  Our innovation provides an approach for low-cost, consumer scale self-quantification. Our technology simultaneously provides the health platform providers a secure, compliant transmission service for self-quantified data.  We have identified four primary customer segments which include 1) professional diagnostic developers, 2) digital and mobile 'self-quantification' health providers which include smartphone health/fitness mobile applications, 3) academic/corporate clinical investigators and 4) epidemiologists.  These customer segments act as distribution channels to the end users who will use the product.  Commercially, our product will penetrate a $46 billion 2020 mobile health market.  Broadly, with widespread use and the expansion of this technology to include the patient de-identified monitoring of a variety of prophylactic, disease and homeostatic biomarkers, current healthcare surveillance programs would be enhanced with geophysical data, improving both disease and wellness tracking.  This would enable the full implementation of predictive analytics, enhancing the way researchers track, monitor and eventually predict wellness and disease worldwide.

    This I-Corps project seeks to perform a thorough customer discovery process of 'self-quantification' users and digital health platform providers to identify the most valuable product parameters before formulating our innovation into a market-ready product.  Our innovation provides a seamless platform which empowers consumers to 'self-quantify' by tracking biomarkers at home.  This activity will generate useful data for research studies and predictive/correlative health outcomes. Our turnkey solution enables any mobile health platform with the ability to incorporate smartphone-compatible rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) into its product portfolio while utilizing our software service to securely transmit smartphone-readable diagnostic results to online databases in accordance with government regulations.  This aspect will be an enabling technology for other uses in the expanding mobile health technology ecosystem. Our RDT will use a lateral flow assay sandwich approach utilizing metatype antibodies and gold nanoparticle synthesis. Proprietary smartphone-intelligible patterns will be formed in the presence of urinary biomarkers. The technological implementation of our approach uses gold nanotechnology processes and protocols.  For example, the underlying, fundamental synthesis processes and protocols used to generate core-shell magnetometallic nanoparticles will be utilized in the synthesis of nanozyme nanotechnology which comprises our proposed smartphone-readable rapid diagnostic test.

    the product of a mobile, smart gait assessment system allowing for continuous
    gait monitoring outside the clinical settings, which can be used for online, remote
    clinical management for patients with gait disorders including patients with Parkinson
    Disease (PD). PD alone affects over one million people in the United States, a
    number that increases by 60,000 each year. This technology will support the prevention
    of re-admission by fall tracking and prevention, lower hospital visits and length
    of stay by allowing at-home monitoring of disease progression, implement monitored
    wellness programs, differentiate disease types by pattern recognition, and provide
    timely and efficient clinical management by tracking interventional outcomes.
    The patient customers will benefit by receiving recommendations on gait and posture
    habits, leading to a decrease in fall occurrences. Moreover, they will benefit
    from activity monitoring by receiving suggestions on exercise routines, which
    have been shown to increase health and fitness. On the other hand, clinics and
    hospitals will benefit from reducing the volume of patients at their facilities,
    and insurance agencies will benefit by decreasing patients' length of stay.  \n\nThis
    I-Corps project proposes a system capable of detecting asymmetry between kinetic
    and kinematic gait parameters, which consists of embedded inertial measurement
    units and insoles with piezoresistive pressure sensor arrays. With machine learning
    algorithms, the system can detect and classify the disease progression, which
    will support treatment modification along with normal disease course and symptomatic
    changes. This smart, non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical approach for disease prognosis
    could also lead to an increase in participation in clinical trials, as the low-risk
    involvement required could encourage persons with and without PD to participate.
    The developed technology allows for continuous gait recordings outside the clinical
    setting. This smart, wireless gait monitoring system has the potential of decreasing
    the burden associated with the numerous clinic visits. The intellectual merits
    lie in the use of emerging technologies, including cloud computing and artificial

    The broader impact of this award is to support the goals of the NSF I-Corps program to increase the economic and societal impact of NSF research funding directly, through enabling commercialization of research, and indirectly, by equipping scientists and engineers with skills and experience in developing and testing economically scalable models for the development of a product or technology. The structured, repeatable program that has been developed engages a national community of institutions and faculty to deliver the training and support these outcomes. Through the work proposed here, this project supports the training of more than 500 additional participants, supports the training of additional faculty to increase the diversity of the faculty pool and maintain fidelity of the program pedagogy, continues conducting systematic data collection and tracking of teams immediately before and long after formal participation in the program, and creates and disseminates datasets of use to both novice and experienced researchers in the field as well as the dissemination of scalable systems for impact measurement that provide both a framework that can be adopted by others in the field.  The systems created through this work, and the insights gained, will advance the understanding of how best to track venture outcomes and assess the impact of early-stage entrepreneurial support programming.

    This NSF project will support the evaluation of I-Corps program outcomes and tracking of program impact in a systematic and timely way.  This work is important to the operation of a consistent, high-fidelity program at scale and to the measurement of long term program results and an understanding of what works. The core intellectual merit of this work is insight into the program's impact, both economic outcomes and participants' career and research outcomes, over time. To gain this insight, the project evaluates the delivery of each cohort, administers a longitudinal outcomes survey, and tracks venture outcomes independently to verify program impact data. Working with NSF, the project makes these datasets accessible to the research community to enable the continued study of how best to support emerging science and technology innovation. The processes and data systems that efficiently track outcomes and provide insights into the development of technology-based products and ventures are a product of this project, as well.

    that can be synthesized from inexpensive earth abundant chemicals, and the material
    holds promise for a broad range of applications, including indoor air purifiers,
    point-of-use or point-of-entry water treatment reactors, self-cleaning and antimicrobial
    paintings/coatings by utilizing sunlight (a type of renewable energy) or indoor
    light. Moreover, the project will be the first to explore the potential market
    of g-C3N4 as a promising advancement for current commercial photocatalysts (e.g.,
    titanium dioxide), accelerate the implementation of innovative materials for industrial,
    civil, and military applications, and enable a new sustainable strategy of pollution
    and pathogen control that will be beneficial for our societal development. \n\nThis
    I-Corps project will advance the commercial application of visible-light-responsive
    g-C3N4 for indoor air purification, water decontamination, and antimicrobial applications
    in different environments (e.g., healthcare, food). The team has developed g-C3N4
    with enhanced photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation and with
    excellent stability, robustness, and biocompatibility. The team has demonstrated
    g-C3N4 effectively degraded organic contaminants in water and inactivated pathogens
    in the form of planktonic bacterial cells and biofilms, under the irradiation
    of both simulated visible sunlight and white light emitting diodes. Reactive species
    for contaminant degradation and pathogen inactivation have been identified, and
    the mechanisms have been elucidated. The team has also initiated the collaboration
    with an industrial partner to fabricate antimicrobial coatings with g-C3N4 for
    both healthcare and food applications.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project revolves around the human brain?s proclivity towards substances detrimental to human health and wellbeing, such as dangerous amounts of sugar, salt, and drugs, which is causing global health and safety risks. Inability to avoid these temptations shortens lifespans, increases healthcare costs, and strains resources. This team will use machine learning and pattern recognition AI to identify and react to factors that result in destructive human behaviors. While the initial intent of our product is to provide potential customers with a tool to detect and prevent addiction overdose and relapse, offer interventions of supervised individuals, conserve emergency response resources, and save taxpayer money, this unsupervised learning AI could, in subsequent iterations, be used to identify and react to any behavior -- such as unsafe driving, binge eating, or anger management. Helping people identify the precursors to their behaviors could serve as a type of biofeedback that gives them and their support networks timely and individualized insights, preventions, and interventions -- some of which could be implemented by Internet of Things enabled devices (e.g. locking a car?s ignition; calling a sponsor; playing calm music; etc.), resulting in cost and health benefits across many populations.

    This I-Corps project is focused on a patent-pending platform to predict and prevent addiction relapses and overdoses by treating those in recovery with timely interventions using wearable devices and artificial intelligence.  Detecting craving states is supported by past and current research, and there is scientific justification for gathering smartphone usage and biometric wearable data on drug users. Researchers have used the combination of smartphone usage and wearables data to predict binge drinking behavior and we plan to apply this research to opioid use. Additionally, cocaine and opioid research uses the same wearable device as our studies. We expand upon current research by combining just-in-time smartphone-based interventions for people in recovery for opioid use disorders with pattern-detection predictive models that will be trained at the population level and refined at the individual level. We will gather data on all relevant factors that determine drug relapse risk state: physiology, smartphone usage, location data, self-reports, and support-network-reports. Once a high-risk state is detected, a smartphone app-based intervention focused on behavior change will then be implemented in a timely and customizable manner.

    to eliminate the barriers to the trading of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)
    and to further accentuate the environmental and sustainability value of green
    energy production. A broad societal benefit of a national market for RECS (NaMaREC)
    is the increased adoption of renewable energy technology through projects such
    as community solar and wind farms leading to reduction in carbon footprints. This
    benefit is higher when the increasing need for energy due to growing populations
    is satisfied with more renewable energy. Renewable utilities will benefit from
    NaMaREC since it will allow them to expand their consumer base and reach consumers
    that may be willing to pay more for the certificate. Nonrenewable utilities can
    use NaMaREC to source RECs from cheaper regions, thus reducing their cost of compliance.
    Ultimately, NaMaREC will provide an avenue to communicate the economics of renewable
    energy adoption to the public through extensive interviews of potential customers.
    This project will form partnerships that includes the academia, industry, and
    start-up ventures to launch NaMaREC. \n\nThis I-Corps project seeks to develop
    an online marketplace named NaMaREC (National Market for Renewable Energy Certificates)
    for the selling and buying of RECs. A REC is a non-tangible, tradable energy commodity
    in the U.S. that represents proof that 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity was
    generated from a renewable energy resource. Currently, there are isolated sellers
    or aggregators of RECs across the U.S. with trades that are neither harmonized
    nor integrated. The business thesis of NaMaREC is to harness the economics of
    scale in the aggregation of RECs in a national market. The underlying motivating
    value for RECs is that 29 states and three territories of the U.S. have a policy
    mandate that requires utilities to generate a certain percentage of their outputs
    from a renewable resource such as solar photovoltaic or wind technology by a target
    date. This mandate, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), may be satisfied by these
    companies either by building the requisite renewable energy capacity or buying
    RECs to satisfy the RPS requirements. Isolated transactions of RECs have limited
    their market viability and accessibility by firms to meet their state-level RPS.
    NaMaREC will transform the trading of RECs in an integrated service that does
    not currently exist.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project are as follows: Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) is a method for obtaining 3D structures of biological molecules. The method has growing importance in basic life science research and in the pharmaceutical sector for defining how drugs interact with their targets. Cryo-EM as a whole has matured into a powerful tool in recent years, culminating in the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, but the process of protein 'sample preparation' for 3D study has not advanced appreciably and is widely considered to represent the major bottleneck in the overall method. This bottleneck also presents a major commercial opportunity. The present project advances new nanofluidic-based technology aimed at addressing this bottleneck. Successful development of this technology will yield a consumable product ready for commercialization. Fulfillment of this goal will greatly advance and open new possibilities in cryo-EM structure determination. The resulting acceleration and enhancement of basic science and drug discovery would translate to broad societal benefit.

    This I-Corps project advances a new technology, supported by prototype data, to breach the major bottleneck in the rapidly growing cryo-EM field, with broad impact in life science and drug discovery. Cryo-EM is performed by taking images of frozen proteins using an electron microscope, then processing the images with a computer to obtain a 3D protein structure. To image and obtain a structure, the protein sample must first be frozen into a thin layer (~50-200 nm). With existing technology, this process is poorly controlled, lacks reproducibility and substantially adds to the time required to get a structure. Our device is designed to directly mitigate these sample preparation problems. It is a self-contained, freezable fluid cell nanofabricated to specification, giving full control over sample geometry and protein environment. Protein is passively loaded into the fluid cell, the loaded device is frozen, and can then be imaged directly. Materials on the top and bottom of the fluid cell are selected to transmit the electron beam through the protein sample with minimal noise. Successful prototype testing and data collection has shown the viability of the core design, with future work focused on refining the design and materials and streamlining manufacturing for eventual commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the use of autonomous robotic systems to save lives across multiple disaster levels by multiplying human efforts in areas such as disaster response, extending to reduced response times and improved rescue efforts during disaster relief. Using autonomous systems, such as drones, that run software which allows for the use of biosensors and on-board machine learning, natural disaster responders can find survivors faster and reduce casualties. The technology understands mission objectives (intent-driven), coordinates with others (collaborative autonomy) and is voice enabled (natural language conversational interface), allowing it to work well with both humans and machines. These and other features lend this technology to broad commercial applications, offering the best strategy to mitigate multiple disaster levels - at the district or provincial level by assessing strengths and vulnerabilities to various hazards; at the community level like search and rescue during a flood or fire; and at the household level like ambulatory drone service care for the aging.

    This I-Corps project will be focused on translating scientific research to commercialization through lessons on the business model canvas and extensive customer discovery. Our research has involved hands-on technical experimentation using deep/machine learning software for prototype development and literature reviews on a variety of software capabilities. Using a camera with machine learning, we were able to identify a human with most of the body obscured. Hardware acts as transport for the optical and acoustical biosensor package which can take action autonomously by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies extending to: realtime onboard object detection capable of identifying a person in rubble, even when the person is partially obscured (Machine/Deep Learning/edge), offline cloud-enriched datasets for cloud-sourced analysis, voice recognition/conversational natural language processing/speech synthesis. Blockchain enabled autonomous swarm management technology on multiple robotic devices will enable multiple machine collaboration. All sensor data is time-stamped and stored in the cloud where the AI technologies are used to enrich the data. Enriched data is made available offline via the internet to thousands of volunteers for human review. Results from our research show that the technological capability exists, the software and hardware components combined meet a need established through our initial customer discovery.

    to optimize outcomes for patients with certain kinds of heart disease and thus
    reduce healthcare costs. We have developed a virtual reality surgical planning
    tool which allows us to better understand which patients are at high risk, and
    better plan surgeries for them. If this tool becomes widely used, the benefits
    could include improving overall outcomes for people with structural heart disease,
    leading to fewer reinterventions, shorter hospital stays, lower healthcare costs,
    and improved quality of life. In addition, these tools may also be useful to neurosurgeons
    and orthopedic surgeons. Finally, if medical education is improved through virtual
    reality, this would lead to better physicians with more knowledge of anatomy.
    Regarding commercial impact, the project has multiple potential commercialization
    pathways. First, end users such as pediatric cardiologists and cardiothoracic
    surgeons can use the virtual reality surgical planning tool for their own patients.
    Further, medical device companies that make valves could use the software to teach
    physicians optimal ways to use their products, and to differentiate from their
    competitors. Finally, imaging companies could package this as the next stage of
    radiology interpretation software. \n\nThis I-Corps project focuses on planning
    structural heart disease interventions and surgeries using true 3D visualization
    with modern virtual reality techniques. These interventions require a detailed
    understanding of how different parts of the anatomy relate to each other in space.
    The development of true 3D visualization has enabled new ways of understanding
    these relationships. Already, it has been shown that the use of 3D printing in
    planning complex cases of congenital heart disease can improve surgical decision-making.
    This resulted in fewer cases where the surgeon had to change her mind about which
    surgery to perform after opening the chest. One would therefore expect better
    outcomes and greater patient satisfaction if the expected procedure is done. In
    addition, early reports suggest that virtual reality may be useful in improving
    surgical education. The virtual reality system in this project has already been
    used to plan innovative heart interventions that were previously not considered
    feasible. What is yet unknown is the extent of the effect on longer-term patient
    outcomes, both within congenital heart disease and in adult structural heart disease.
    Further development of virtual reality surgical planning tools will allow the
    field to advance as we investigate the contribution virtual reality can make.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is pivoted around the emerging whole slide imaging market segment in digital pathology. The digital pathology market is predicted to reach over $800 million by 2025. The motivation of this project stems from the gigabyte size of whole slide images (WSIs), which are digital images of glass slides produced at near optical resolution. With rapid increase in the number of WSIs produced by hospitals and pathology labs, the storage and management of WSIs has become an urgent problem to tackle for next-generation image analytics. The commercial viability of the project can significantly impact researchers, medical professionals, software developers, and IT staff who wish to manage large number of WSIs using modern cluster computing and big data techniques. Thus, next-generation image analytics (e.g., using deep learning) for automatic detection and analysis of cellular and morphological features in human tissues can be performed faster on large numbers of WSIs. The potential societal benefit of the project includes enabling improved diagnosis of diseases by pathologists using next-generation image analytics and the creation of a tech startup leading to new jobs. This project will provide training to two Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups in STEM.

    This I-Corps project is based on a software technology that aims to solve the fundamental problem of scalable storage of WSIs and fast retrieval of tiles using a commodity cluster and big data techniques. The value proposition of the technology is efficient and cost-effective storage of large-scale WSIs and fast retrieval of tiles to enable next-generation image analytics for human disease diagnosis. The technology encompasses intelligent data partitioning using space-filling curves, in-memory data structures, and effective organization of tiles to enable fast retrieval of tiles during image analysis. It employs space-efficient storage formats to maximize storage efficiency. On an average, it required a few seconds to retrieve a single tile on 80 WSIs using a 16-node cluster. Therefore, we believe next-generation image analytics on WSIs (e.g., using deep learning) can run faster on large number of WSIs, which can consume terabytes of storage, through faster access of image tiles. As the technology relies on commodity hardware and open source software, it is cost-effective and can be easily deployed as a product or a service. The technology has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in WSI storage and management using a big data approach.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project derives from its promise to positively affect not only consumers, but also enhance efficiencies in the electric energy marketplace as a whole. The basic functionality of matching users to optimal electric plans will result in both higher consumer satisfaction, and result in Retail Electric Providers (REPs) offering more competitive rate packages.  Identifying the actual usage profile of appliances over time and providing actionable information to consumers will enable consumers to take informed decisions on appliance purchases, as well as manufacturers to optimize designs with real-world inputs.   The platform will enable the solution of system-wide problems faced by utility companies like peak period demand surges to be countered through demand response initiatives such as incentivizing customers to modify their usage patterns to smoothen the load curve.  Each function of the proposed system is geared toward addressing a specific source of friction in the electric energy marketplace, and consequently also possesses commercial potential.  Thus, the overall economic impact will be on consumers, REPs, utility companies and appliance manufactures, while promoting a greater knowledge and engagement among the electricity consumers.

    This I-Corps project explores the value of creating a bundled energy management system aimed at residential users.  The system uses machine-learning-based analytics of the customer's daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal energy usage trends to offer potential savings through (1) recommending the best retail energy service provider plan matching the customer's usage patterns, (2) incentivizing customers to enable full integration with smart home devices, including smart thermostats, (3) identifying and predicting the electricity consumption of different appliances and providing actionable information on their optimal usage and maintenance, and (4) services to allow customers to navigate through the process of switching plans. A smartphone app available for the iOS and Android platforms forms the customer interface to the system.  The key novelties of this project lie in the development and integration of machine learning tools and behavioral economics ideas into the domain of residential energy management.  The project is founded on research into the design, development and validation of such tools in contexts such as predicting residential energy usage over time, disaggregating usage on a per-appliance basis, and experimentation on how best to motivate users to engage in energy usage behavior that induces efficient grid operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a significantly improved in-field data collection and data analysis workflow.  This technology leverages the widespread use of smartphones around the world by providing a robust digital platform with low hardware requirements for collecting and understanding data.  By digitizing inputs from the beginning of the data collection process and providing live analysis, the platform reduces the cost, time, and expertise required to collect and understand the information contained within datasets.  The technology can benefit diverse industries, but has particular application to municipal governments and NGOs, where project managers need to regularly monitor the effect of their program.  Their ability to do so and make the necessary adjustments directly impact the effectiveness and efficiency of the projects.  The technology has significant commercial potential beyond governments and NGOs, and impacts any industry that requires rapid and reliable data insights for decision making.  Over time, the technology will make data collection and usage more accessible to empower average people to better advocate for their community.

    This I-Corps project aims to explore the commercial potential of a fully digital in-field data platform. The technology allows any team to quickly collect and analyze in-field data.  A robust software platform forms the core of the technology. The platform automatically tags data with GPS and time information and provides live visualization of data and team activity with minimal hardware requirements. Advanced mobile algorithms manage data caching and cloud uploading. These algorithms enable the platform to operate reliably in areas with intermittent internet connection and protect data during hardware crashes.

    to democratize the power of machine learning and predictive analytics to help
    non-engineering business personnel realize the full value of their data. Enabling
    this will drive better organizational decision making at all levels and the creation
    of additional business value for commercial and governmental organizations of
    all kinds, and of all sizes. Data-driven decisions using big data analytics holds
    massive promise, but has largely remained unfulfilled primarily because, in its
    current form, it is unaffordable to all but the most technologically advanced
    organizations. Data-driven businesses have 5-6% higher productivity and can potentially
    add $3 Trillion in value globally, per year. A wide range of sectors, such as
    manufacturing, retail, finance, healthcare, security, and governmental services
    will see significant commercial impact including higher productivity, better utilization
    of resources, and the acceleration of the deployment of new products, services,
    and technologies. By enabling commercial and governmental entities to more effectively
    utilize their data and resources, businesses and government agencies will increase
    their productivity, more effectively utilize their personnel, improve their competitiveness,
    and eliminate waste resources while increasing the flow of products and services
    that benefit society at large. \n\nThis I-Corps project is based on ground breaking
    technology meant to realize a scalable, flexible and easy-to-use data-processing
    infrastructure. At the highest level, building such a platform requires: (a) coming
    up with the right abstraction or language that accommodates all sorts of computation
    at scale; (b) implementing the architecture to realize such computation at scale;
    (c) the ability to go from \"sandboxing\" or \"prototyping\" to a production environment
    instantly; and (d) the ability to work in heterogenous data environments instantly.
    We have put forth a novel computational language, called factor graph computing.
    Such a computation framework is \"Turing complete\". Factor graph computing allows
    for performing data transformation, predictive modeling, and optimization at scale
    to enable data-driven decisions. Such a platform eliminates the need for data
    engineering, provides flexibility to build predictive models instantly, allows
    for seamless evolution by bringing in new datasets in the mix, and requires minimal
    support to maintain the infrastructure and allow for generating prescriptive decisions

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the project's technology, based on computing, engineering and materials technologies, may provide a sense of safety and comfort to anosmics (those who suffer from a loss of a sense of smell).  People with a loss of their sense of smell are typically  concerned about being near potential hazards that are difficult to detect without a sense of smell, such as fires, gas leaks, food that is spoiling, and hazardous chemicals. As there are no methods or products that can closely mimic the human nose, the detection performance and user-friendliness of a substitute device will target a relatively untapped market -- approximately 5% of the general population or over 15 million people in the United States alone. It is anticipated that this project's device will be a more affordable, reliable and less invasive alternative to surgery or other treatments. Furthermore, the technology can be used in a wide range of applications, such as drug or explosives detection, food quality monitoring (such as identifying diseases and/or ripeness of fruits and other produce), air quality monitoring and control, harmful solvent detection for defense application, and smart bandage for wound monitoring.

    This I-Corps project involves the manufacture of a device with a high-density, high-performance gas sensor array based on nanotechnology, chemistry, computer science and engineering. The facile, fast fabrication methods of nanomaterials as sensing materials introduces the possibility of mass manufacturing. Real-time response to a range of gas analytes along with fast recovery of the sensing medium provides a solid technical foundation for this project. Currently at a pre-alpha prototyping stage, the device, with its full integration with a custom-designed circuit board and precisely fabricated sensing nanomaterials, not only eliminates the need for tedious and costly microfabrication, which is typical for gas sensors, but may also be able to imitate the detection level of a human nose, even exceeding the detection performance for some gas analytes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to understand the problems that the industry and federal agencies face during the operation of underwater vehicles for applications such as, ocean monitoring, inspection of coastal structures, rescue missions and/or hydrographic survey. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are key for multiple underwater missions including detecting and mapping submerged wrecks, ocean bed-floor, polluted water, as well as surveillance of coastal zones and coastal structures. In many circumstances AUVs are preferred over conventional towed instruments or marine surface vehicles because AUVs can get closer to the area of interest, they can cover large areas without constant monitoring or hover hazardous areas without putting at risk humans life. Although current AUVs have many capabilities, one main limitation is their inability to perform precise station-keeping which allows the vehicle to hold its position and adjust for currents. New technology in underwater propulsion will permit the development and control of a new generation of highly maneuverable vessels that have to operate in more challenging environments. The proposed work is expected to increase the partnership between academia, marine industries and national defense agencies. In addition, it will promote the progress of science and national security using bio-inspired technology.

    This I-Corps project focuses in the propulsion technology and control strategy for AUVs that needs to operate in tight space, low-speed with high mobility and perform station-keeping missions. Bio-inspired undulating fin can provide multiple advantages including: superior maneuverability to control forward motion and directional maneuver with a single undulating fin; precise maneuvers suitable for station-keeping and maneuvers in tight spaces; reduce risk to get tangled in marine plants and ropes with less impact on the marine ecosystem; relative low speed with likely lower acoustic signature.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to eliminate antibiotic use during biomanufacturing in the chemical and biotechnology industries, and to enable robust, contamination-free continuous processes that reduce upstream costs by 20-50%. Currently the biotechnology industry is growing at an astounding 7.5% per annum with a predicted value of $760B by 2025.  However, industrial fermentation plant failure data collected over a 15-year period suggests that 1 in 10 process cultures are subject to microbial contamination and associated production failure. Furthermore, while continuous bioreactor processes significantly improve productivity and reduce unit operation costs, most biotechnology industries shy away from them because of the inherent sensitivity to contamination.  Reduced bioreactor failure rate and operational cost is essential for the economic viability of bio-commodity chemicals such as biofuels, as production costs are a big impediment to large-scale manufacture; and their market demand depends primarily on their price competitiveness with petroleum-derived counterparts. Our technology can increase the productivity and profit margin of these companies. With our technology, large-scale bio-commodity chemicals production could become economically feasible. In addition to reduced operational costs, antibiotic-free production alleviates antibiotic misuse in industries to promote a positive environmental and public heath impact.

    This I-Corps project comprises a novel biocide/biocide-resistant system that could be used to treat and prevent microbial contamination in bioreactors. This technology allows bioprocessing engineers to eliminate the microbial contamination problem by addition of a biocide into the bioprocessing hosts' growth medium. The biocide prohibits the outgrowth of accidental contaminants while a biocide-resistant enzyme protects the bioprocessing host. The system also contains an on/off switch that allows easy removal of the biocide as needed. Preliminary data demonstrates that heterologous expression of the biocide-resistant enzyme in Escherichia coli and subsequent directed evolution resulted in a biocide-resistant Escherichia coli with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) approximately 16 times higher than the negative controls. We further demonstrate that this biocide in combination with the expression of biocide-resistant enzyme can be used to successfully treat a contaminated bioreactor.

    The broader impact/commercialization potential of this I-Corps project involves the application of multi-sensor technologies to  improve the management and treatment of patients with implanted catheters. Catheter blockage and failure results in ineffective treatment, leading to life-threatening symptoms. Hydrocephalus patients are particularly vulnerable due to their life-long dependence on implanted catheters and suffer significantly due to high implant failure rate (>40% in year 1, >80% within a decade). Over one million Americans currently live with hydrocephalus, and require constant drainage of cerebrospinal fluid via implanted catheter. Repeated imaging studies and invasive procedures are used to monitor catheter performance, but these methods are expensive and inadequate. MRI/CT imaging can identify catheter failure in fewer than 50% of cases. Even when combined with invasive tests, patients are often misdiagnosed and undergo unnecessary surgery. Noninvasive monitoring of hydrocephalus catheter status could eliminate expensive tests and unnecessary operations, saving the US healthcare system $2 billion annually and immeasurably improve patient quality of life. Numerous other diseases in the cardiovascular, urinary, and renal spaces also require chronically implanted catheters and would benefit from noninvasive catheter monitoring. Improving catheter monitoring would also increase scientific knowledge of chronic diseases, providing an important tool for research and therapy development.

    This I-Corps project explores the commercialization potential for a multi-sensor catheter which can be implanted in the human body. Few sensors exist on the market that can operate for long periods in the human body. There are no suitable sensor technologies for chronically implanted catheters. This team developed a new sensor technology based on microscale electrodes that are low profile and eliminate the need for encapsulation or protection against the harsh environments found in vivo. They are made only of inert biocompatible materials, such as platinum and Parylene C, which have long been used in FDA approved medical implants. The pressure sensor operates by monitoring the response of a microbubble to changes in pressure. The flow sensor uses a microscopic heater and electrodes to measure heat transfer via flowing fluid. The sensor measures the electrical signal between electrodes inside and outside of a catheter to measure blockage. Clinical tests of these sensors are currently underway in pediatric patients with external ventricular drains.

    and others by providing superior energy dissipation in protective apparel. One
    such promising application is an additional lining material in football helmets
    to reduce the occurrence of concussions. Other potential fields include energy
    absorbing and vibration damping applications for the automotive or aerospace industries
    ranging from passenger safety and comfort to isolating critical electronic components
    in the event of impact, damage, and instability. Each of these applications aims
    to improve human health and safety, and represents billion dollars a year markets
    and hundreds of thousands of potential users. \n\nThis I-Corps project will combine
    the complementary properties of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) and nickel-titanium
    (NiTi) to create a unique composite material that has exceptional mechanical properties,
    and a high degree of tailorable behavior. Research into LCEs has proven they have
    excellent energy absorbing behavior and toughness, with performance exceeding
    that of most other rubber-like materials. However, typical polyurethane rubbers
    or silicones are inherently soft and/or have a slow recovery from large deformations;
    this limits its usefulness in many important situations. NiTi is the ideal material
    to compliment these shortcomings due to its own set of unique characteristics.
    Similar to metals, it is orders of magnitude stronger and stiffer than LCEs, but
    NiTi also undergoes shape-memory behavior that leads large recoverable deformation.
    Additionally, it also provides biasing stress to the LCEs that should greatly
    reduce the recovery time of the composite material. The combination of these unique
    and varied properties will give the composite material a level of customization
    and tailored behavior that is simply not achievable with any of the constituents
    independently and will be of interest from both a research perspective and attractive
    as a marketable product.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
    been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a lead enrichment kit that can allow fast detection of lead in water with low cost and low detection limit. Lead contamination in drinking water is a threat to human beings. Due to its health concern, the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) has set an action level of 15 µg/L for lead in tap water. Considering the great threat of lead to health even with low concentrations, it is necessary to have lead measurements in water at a regular basis. The proposed project aims to commercialize an inexpensive kit which would allow fast lead detection in water with low detection limit to meet Lead and Copper Rule (15 ppb). The kit provides two main benefits to customers: a lower cost ($4) than current kit ($11) for lead detection which meets Lead and Copper Rule and convenience for field sample measurements.

    This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the commercial adoption of our inexpensive lead enrichment kit for lead detection. Interviews will be conducted to help identify the potential customers and the market needs, evaluate the commercialization feasibility of the new technology, and optimize the technology to meet the demand of targeted customers. Inspired by findings from our current NSF-project, special enrichment kit was designed to accumulate Pb from water, allowing quick detection of lead in water with low concentrations using the inexpensive detection kit. Additionally, the proposed work will provide the basis for future development and commercialization of new enrichment kits to detect other aqueous contaminants in water with low detection limits.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will directly affect the treatment and management of the over 80 km3 of wastewater and solid wastes produced each year in the US. Waste treatment processes are directly tied to environmental and human health in both developed and developing countries but are subject to high costs due to significant energy and maintenance requirements. Municipal wastewater treatment alone accounts for about 3% of electrical energy consumed in the U.S and other developed countries. The successful implementation of the proposed technology, which integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into existing waste treatment infrastructure, has the potential to greatly improve the management of microbial communities associated with treatment processes thereby improving overall effectiveness and sustainability. This solution represents a new way for customers to cut energy and operational costs and improve effectiveness of their treatment processes without large investments in infrastructure. Potential markets for this technology include public, municipal facilities in addition to treatment facilities in the industrial/agricultural sector.  Development of the proposed technology will likely spur additional applications of AI systems in other fields centered around microbial community based engineered systems like bioproduct production, biosensing, and bioremediation.

    This I-Corps project is based on our recent development of a machine learning based approach used to accurately predict microbial community structure, process stability, and reactor performance for wastewater treatment. This novel approach, which incorporates genomic data along with environmental and operational parameters into data-mining datasets has demonstrated significant increases in accurately predicting process stability and performance of small-scale wastewater systems compared to models developed without consideration of microbial community dynamics. The predictive models developed through the construction of artificial neural networks have potential to inform engineering decisions for optimized performance and stability of environmental biotechnologies in full-scale systems. Development and implementation of this approach will not only progress the understanding and control of microbial communities that inhabit environmental biotechnologies but may be expanded to other microbiomes such as those associated with human health and biogeochemical cycles.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be a reduction in food losses and waste.  Roughly one third of the food produced in the world gets lost or wasted.  A large portion of this waste is due to proper cold-chain infrastructure from farms to consumers.  Transport refrigeration is an expensive option that consumes large amounts of diesel fuel.  The transport industry can see significant cost savings by converting to energy-efficient refrigeration units that utilize waste heat rather than using dedicated diesel engines.  This could make refrigeration more accessible to farmers, retailers and food processors everywhere.  The project is has the potential significantly reduce food waste worldwide.

     This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization potential of a new material that can absorb up to 82% water by weight, nearly twice the amount of the previous best material.  This highly absorbent material also demonstrates a record cooling capacity per given volume.  These capabilities open up a new class of applications in transport refrigeration where equipment weight and size need to be minimized.  An adsorption refrigeration cycle operating with this material can efficiently harvest waste heat from a truck's engine to produce two times the cooling power of a conventional vapor compressor system without using additional diesel fuel.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the use of embedded machine listening as a low-cost, turnkey solution for early detection of machinery malfunction and improve predictive maintenance. In manufacturing, sound-based condition monitoring coupled with data-driven maintenance can help significantly reduce unscheduled work stoppages, faulty products and waste of raw materials. Building management systems can be augmented by integrating real-time condition updates for critical machinery such as HVAC units, elevators, boilers and pumps, minimizing disruption for managers and users of those services. This technology is flexible, accurate and data-driven, potentially providing a low barrier to adoption for prospective customers and adaptability to various markets. Beyond predictive maintenance, applications include noise level monitoring for ensuring compliance in workplaces and airports, home and building security, early alert for traffic accidents, bio-acoustic monitoring of animal species, and outdoor noise monitoring at scale for improved enforcement in smart cities.

    This I-Corps project further develops research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and the internet of things. The technology consists of a calibrated and highly accurate acoustic sensor with embedded sound recognition AI based on deep learning.  Sound conveys critical information about the environment that often cannot be measured by other means. In manufacturing, early stage machinery malfunction can be indicated by abnormal acoustic emissions. In smart homes and buildings, sound can be monitored for signs of alarm, distress or compliance.  Sound sensing is omnidirectional and robust to occlusion and contextual variables such as lightning conditions at different times of the day. Many existing solutions cannot identify different types of sounds or complex acoustic patterns, making them unsuited for these applications. This solution is both low cost and capable of identifying events and sources at the network edge, thus eliminating the need for sensitive audio information to be transmitted.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a path for integrating photovoltaics into a wide range of new form factors. The project will first explore the commercial potential of integrating high-performance, light-weight flexible solar panels onto freight truck trailers, shading fabrics, and military tents. When the large exterior surfaces of a freight truck trailer are covered by high-efficiency solar panels the technology can significantly improve overall diesel fuel efficiencies.  Retrofitting flexible solar panels onto shading fabrics, such as canopies, awnings, and car parking ports can potentially allow for local, potentially off-grid, power sources. The flexible solar panels will also potentially help the military cope with their power needs for operations occur in remote locations.  All these applications rely on the new form factors the core technology in this project enables.

    This I-Corps project is based on core technology that overcomes major obstacles in perovskite solar cells, including their short lifetime, lengthy processing steps, and substantial efficiency drops from large-area fabrication on flexible substrates. Commonly used annealing approaches require prolonged heating at high temperatures to attain desired material properties. Therefore, they are not typically compatible with high-speed printing. The technology developed here accomplishes a rapid layer-specific photonic treatment for the target layer without damaging the underlying flexible substrate and perovskite materials. This innovative technology enables large-scale manufacturing of durable and fully-flexible perovskite solar cells through high-speed printing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to build a recommender system which assigns values to artifacts and will also provide stakeholders in unregulated markets with better information for reducing risk and improving trust. The Internet and technology have entirely changed the nature of interactions between every business sector, including the art industry, by creating a digital marketplace and introducing additional issues for markets regulation. The proposed recommender system can be used to predict value of investment, to provide an objective value of goods in legal proceedings, insurance cases, and banks as a collateral toll.  This supports financial stability of markets through better decision making and improves the trust of stakeholders in their investments. It also helps to maintain control of the commercial aspects of work. For example, the acquisitions departments of museums would be served by knowing a real value for the artifacts they buy.

    This I-Corps project is focused on building a recommender system for assigning values to artworks using existing datasets and deep knowledge. Art markets are often misvalued which makes the classical approach to building recommender systems rather difficult due to unreliable datasets. Classifiers trained on these datasets often assign inflated prices. A crowd approach is used here which is expected to give more reliable results. Personalization for this class of problems can be achieved by assigning semantic distance.  The project extends the group of classical features by adding semantic features from mining comments given by users, and, for example, from artist biographies, and images of paintings. For each cluster of semantically similar artists, a personalized recommender system for art evaluation is built. Wisdom of the crowd will be used to assign a specific value to an art piece.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the commercial potential of an educational innovation that can transform aspects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and arts education in both formal and informal settings through the construction, analysis, and performance upon a set of custom musical instruments.  By coupling rigorous STEM learning with musical concepts, the technology can engage a diverse group of students in STEM who may otherwise not express an interest.  The technology may be commercialized in a variety of ways, ranging from kits for the home market to complete curricula for school programs.  Commercialization of the technology has significant potential to improve educational outcomes in these important STEM areas.

    This I-Corps project builds upon a technology base of custom acoustical and electronic musical instruments that was initially developed for an educational program that has been attended by over 2,000 people in 10 states at schools, museums, and performing arts centers.  The intellectual merit of the work derives from the close coupling between musical content and state K-12 standards in mathematics, science, and engineering.  A pilot 6-week after school program for third grade students used the technology to draw connections between music and fractions, geometry, the physics of sound, engineering materials, and engineering design, which are all topics in the educational standards for that grade level.  Prototype instruments for higher grade levels illustrate concepts in algebra, pre-calculus, electronics, and computer programming.

    This I-Corps project will develop effective, unbiased, and automated platforms and algorithms for skill assessment. The target customers will be the companies, and university graduates that would like to enter the job market with no prior experience. This research will propose novel techniques and working tools using artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to provide interaction during the interview process between the assessment engine and the interviewee. The project further develops novel formal methods and programming language analysis techniques to analyze the answers submitted by the candidate during the interview and adaptively select the next sequence of questions for each specific candidate. A realistic test-bed infrastructures on which the candidates will be asked to perform experiments is used to assess the expertise level of the candidates.  These novel techniques for automated interviews will reduce the cost and time for both companies and students.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to act as a catalyst in the growth of distributed generation and microgrid industries. This artificial intelligence based control system will potentially provide an electrical network that is reliable by reducing outages and restoration costs with incredibly fast bidirectional power flow, secured with real time diagnostics, self-healing and adaptive capabilities, and more economical by reducing equipment failures and minimizing power losses. The product potentially three broad markets, including utilities, distributed generation and consumer. The solution will enhance energy generation from renewables, improve microgrid efficiency, reliability, stability and power quality, and add intelligent control to conventional power systems. Inverter capabilities are presently a significant challenge for integrating distributed generation sources. The proposed innovation would potentially provide an appropriate solution to address this challenge.

    This I-Corps project develops a neural network control technology for microgrid control and management. Microgrids are one path for integrating renewable and distributed generation sources into the grid and can generally support a future smart electricity grid.  A key challenge in microgrid adoption is adequate control of power inverters. Problems include high oscillations when connecting or disconnecting an energy source, fluctuating voltage and frequency, malfunctions and reliability, competing control between inverters, and high harmonic distortions. The proposed innovation uses adaptive dynamic programming and artificial neural networks to implement microgrid control. It integrates into one controller the advantages of conventional control methods, including optimal control, proportional integral control, predictive control, and sliding mode control. The proposed innovation has the potential to overcome the limitations of the conventional control technologies and better meet customer demands and requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to generate technology that improves the accuracy of medical diagnostic tests and eases restrictions on the collection of tissue from patients. If it can be widely disseminated through commercialization, this technology will allow patients to receive a more accurate diagnosis of diseases like cancer, with a more rapid turnaround time and lower cost to the healthcare system. Moreover, secondary biopsies or blood draws that are painful and expensive can be avoided. The project has exceptional potential for commercialization due to the multi-billion dollar market for diagnostic tests at present and due to clear pressing clinical needs to fill in technological gaps that limit the accuracy of diagnostic tests for cancer.

    The I-Corps project is focused on a new generation of light-emitting nanoparticles that function as the critical means to perform measurements in medical diagnostic tests. These new nanoparticles, called quantum dots, provide the new ability to count individual molecules in diseased tissue and in blood, which is a major leap forward in diagnostic testing compared with standard tests that simply provide a qualitative outcome of "high" or "low." Moreover, quantum dots allow the simultaneous interrogation of numerous classes of molecules related to diseases, instead of having to perform repeated tests. Importantly, this technology can be implemented on low-cost instruments that are already widely available in medical diagnostics labs, so there are few barriers preventing entry into the market.  Outcomes have been validated in a research laboratory setting, however they must be scaled for commercialization and finely tuned to meet specific needs in medical diagnostics settings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project it to reduce the impact of future earthquakes.  This smartphone-based crowdsource sensing application provides earthquake alerts and shaking hazard data. The vision is to provide earthquake early warning around the globe, and collect data on building performance.  Warnings can be used to slow and stop trains reducing the likelihood of derailment, to isolate hazardous chemicals and machinery to reduce damage, to move data to safe storage, and to signal individuals to move to a safe place.  Shaking data recoded in buildings can also be used to assess the performance of a building during an earthquake.  Recorded shaking in smaller non-damaging quakes can be used to predict building performance in larger events.  The data recorded by application enabled phones can potentially be used by structural engineers to assess buildings, and can be used by the insurance industry to set premiums.

    This I-Corps project develops a global smartphone-based seismic network.  The technology uses machine learning techniques to distinguish between earthquakes and other sources of shaking as recorded on personal/private smartphones, and is embedded in the application that has been downloaded by over 250,000 users around the world.  When a phone detects an earthquake, it notifies a central server.  The server confirms the earthquake based on multiple phone detection, and estimates the size and location.  An alert could then be issued to users.  At the same time, the phone records the ground shaking during the earthquake.  This timeseries data can be used for a range of purposes including fundamental research on earthquake processes, and characterization of buildings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to introduce a fully integrated current sensor with an order of magnitude performance improvement over the state-of-art technologies. The developed technology will enable more reliable, efficient and compact power electronics systems. Power electronics is an integral part of today's power delivery systems such as renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, data centers and most consumer electronics. In these applications, electric current information is often an essential parameter that needs to be known and measured for control, diagnostic and prognostic purposes. With advances in power electronic circuits with specific attention to high frequency power converters, there is a need to investigate alternative approaches and techniques to measure the current. These approaches should result in availability of current sensors that have fast-response, are accurate, loss-less, and preferably non-intrusive. The impact of such a sensor is to enable systems and circuits that will be miniaturized and more efficient through the use of wide band-gap semiconductors and high switching frequencies. Additionally, the availability of current measurement information will lead to greater reliability and prognostic capability. Applications include power converters in electric vehicles and data centers.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of the current sensor technology in different industry sectors such as automotive, telecommunications, and data centers. Today, there is no current sensor that can be used in many power electronics systems or integrated into semiconductor modules optimized to operate with switching frequencies beyond 1MHz. This project will address the need and requirements for such sensors by moving away from commonly-used Hall-Effect sensors and utilizing magneto-resistors. With proprietary IC circuitry and packaging, the project team is developing contactless, lossless sensors with bandwidths up to 10 MHz, while overcoming the measurement challenges due to EMI, asymmetrical current distributions and non-uniform magnetic field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide K-12 schools with a learning environment, curriculum, and teacher training to expand and improve computer science education and to encourage a diverse student population to pursue further studies in computing. Computer science has become a core 21st century skill critical to careers both within and beyond the tech industry, but K-12 education has yet to meet increasing demand from industry and from parents to teach computing, and school districts still struggle to adequately train teachers and to engage students in computer science. This project provides a simple and easy-to-use solution that integrates music with computer science to drive student engagement. Moreover, this approach contributes to a diverse computer science pipeline by engaging female and minority students through an emphasis on creativity and real-world applications. Today there is a market for schools to train teachers, and to buy materials and tools to teach computer science.

    This I-Corps project leverages an online learning environment, curriculum, and teacher training designed for any introductory computing course from late elementary through to the college level, along with a body of research assessing the effects of this learning intervention on student content knowledge and engagement in computing. The web-based learning platform includes a code editor, a multi-track audio player, an audio loop library, an interactive textbook, and mechanisms for students to share and collaborate, along with curricular, training, and grading tools for teachers. Mixed-methods research has shown significant student gains in both content knowledge and engagement across gender and demographic groups when learning with this approach, with particularly large gains in engagement for female students. Students ascribe their increased engagement in computing to the creative, expressive, and real-world approach of the intervention through its combination of popular music and music production techniques with computational thinking and programming in industry-relevant coding languages.

    Tephritid fruit fly Multidisciplinary Australian Research Collaboration for Biosecurity (T-MARC-BIO), a Track I IRES project at Eastern Mennonite University (EMU), will engage 18 undergraduate students from the state of Virginia to gain multidisciplinary research experience in Australia that will advance basic science and address internationally significant challenges in ensuring biosecurity and a robust global food supply chain. Students will be recruited from EMU and neighboring institutions to conduct research on fruit flies (Tephritidae), which are among the most damaging horticultural insect pests worldwide, constituting pest management issues, trade barriers, and invasion threats for Australia, the U.S., and throughout the tropics and subtropics. The results of this research will have an impact on integrated pest management, which is a critical component of sustainable agro-ecological systems in the U.S. and worldwide. With good cause, the public is becoming increasingly concerned about the health and environmental impacts of synthetic pesticides, and their use is becoming highly restricted. The T-MARC-BIO program will add to the toolkit of effective, long-term strategies for both pest control and monitoring of invasive species, while minimizing the impacts of pesticides on human and environmental health. American students will gain valuable research experience through conducting projects in the multidisciplinary settings in Australia, as well as the life-changing learning, interpersonal skills, empathy, and global awareness that come from living and working in a foreign country. T-MARC-BIO will contribute to developing a diverse, globally engaged scientific workforce pipeline by recruiting highly qualified female, low-income, and minority students, who are underrepresented in the sciences.

    Through T-MARC-BIO, students will (1) participate in a semester-long pre-travel research preparation and cross-cultural program, (2) conduct rigorous individual research projects on tephritid fruit flies during a seven-week period in Australia, (3) immerse themselves in Australian culture as they participate in research fields with global interest and impact, and (4) communicate their research through scientific journals and presentations, and in the local community. The U.S. and Australia make significant research investments to both enhance control of existing pest fly populations and improve interdiction of invasive flies entering the respective countries. The results of T-MARC-BIO student-assisted research will advance knowledge in three areas: tephritid fruit fly physiology and behavior, organic analysis and synthesis of fruit fly lures, and field ecology and management techniques. Collectively, these results will address gaps in understanding of how fruit flies metabolize secondary plant compounds, what they smell and what attracts them, how they move in the environment, and how to develop more effective control techniques, such as attractant fruit fly lures. Evaluation findings about the T-MARC-BIO project will be applicable to small (two- and four-year) colleges, their administrators, and STEM faculty. T-MARC-BIO students will share the benefits of enriched, multidisciplinary academic research training and participating in publishable research that advances STEM fields, as well as basic and applied science.

    This IRES Track I project will support collaborative research to develop new algorithms and techniques for reliability-aware physical design and optimization of VLSI systems. U.S. students will be trained through collaborative research between two teams -- UCR's VLSI System and Computation Research Lab (VSCLAB) and Tsinghua University's Design Automation Lab.   Each year five American students will participate in the IRES program. IRES students will spend 10 weeks (one academic quarter) at UCR and 10 weeks at Tsinghua University, China. Specific IRES collaborative research, education and culture activities are planned to expose U.S. undergraduate or graduate students to the global engineering education and research environment through US-China academic collaboration. The collaborative educational and research activities will provide unique training, mentoring, networking and intellectual development opportunities for students at UCR, which is a growing and Minority Serving Institution. This project thus provides a unique opportunity to contribute to diversity in the U.S. technical workforce. Such international engagement will benefit the students' entire careers and make them more competitive and competent in their careers as scientists and engineers.  Furthermore, building long-term connections with top-tier engineering schools like Tsinghua University will help U.S. scientists and engineers maintain competitiveness in the long term.  Finally, the joint research will strengthen existing computer engineering research and education programs, and broaden the collaborative research work at UCR.

     The IRES collaborative project will produce important research advances through joint development of efficient algorithms and design methodologies to address the grand challenges of reliability-aware physical design and optimization of VLSI systems. The researchers will work on the most severe and challenging aspects of verification and design problems of silicon CMOS based integrated systems in current and coming 10nm/7nm nodes: modeling, analysis of long-term interconnect reliability effects such as electromigration (EM), time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB), bias temperature instability (BTI) and reliability-aware physical design and optimization. The mutual interests and complementary knowledge, and established trust between the two research teams is critical for the success of the student training, mentoring and the proposed joint research project. The education and research activities of this joint project consist of following activities: student training, mentoring and intellectual development via pre-trip preparation and on-site visits; new courses and seminar development for proposed research topics; joint research projects and student supervision and publications; promoting and nurturing diverse cohorts of U.S. students; evaluation for continuous improvement of the program.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be accomplished through helping more than 85 million US pet owners and their pets, as owning a companion animal is associated with improved well-being. The provisional-patent-protected innovation, a single-test immunoassay for pet disease diagnosis, is expected to lead to significant outcomes in the animal healthcare commercial market, with an option of expanding to other markets.

    This project is based on technology that combines in a single test (such as a paper strip test) the high sensitivity, selectivity and wide working range of the particle immunoassay for diagnosing pets' diseases at various stages. The unique feature of our test is high sensitivity with the incorporated protection against false-negative analytical bias caused by the high dose effect, which is important for the diagnostic accuracy of late- and early-stage disease. The selectivity of the test has been demonstrated to detect about 0.01 Units per milliliter of ovarian cancer biomarker 125 in human blood plasma, with near single-molecule assay selectivity. In the proof-of-concept experiment, the proposed approach was modified based on the heterogeneous-media encapsulation of gold nanoparticles modified with biotin and iron oxide microparticles modified with streptavidin. This test offers significant competitive advantages over existing technologies: it can be used for early- and late-stages of disease; manufacturing and operational costs are low, based on a cheap point-of-care application; and it offers the possibility of detecting multiple modalities of disease in one test.

    Supercomputers enable researchers to push the boundaries of science and find innovative approaches to complex problems. From improving advanced manufacturing with modeling and simulation to understanding earth systems and weather with greater precision, harnessing the data revolution and applying data to understand life processes, supercomputers are essential to human advancement.  HPC (High Performing Computer) systems of the future will likely be very different from those of today. Emerging architectures can have a tremendous impact on the development of software, methods and models that can take advantage of these new features resulting in speed up and improvement in the accuracy of calculations. Early adoption of these emerging technologies to take advantage of special features is key to remaining competitive in the global economy. The goal of this IRES site is to engage PhD. students in research learning experiences that increase their capacity to conduct research on supercomputing systems, (including those with classical and emerging architectures), and their exposure to international collaborative research.

    This IRES, called ASSURE, aims to enhance the capabilities of US graduate students to develop Algorithms and Software in key scientific disciplines that benefit from Supercomputers and emerging aRchitEctures (ASSURE). The program focuses on equipping students to conduct research on one of the fastest supercomputers in the world, Sunway Taihulight, housed in Wuxi China, which has a unique architecture. ASSURE achieves this goal by: (i) training students to utilize unique international large-scale systems; (ii) engaging students in high quality collaborative research in four key areas of computational and data science utilizing these systems; and (iii) exposing students to international large-scale research environments that prepare them with cultural and professional skills required to occupy international leadership roles. Specifically, IRES students at this site will conduct research at two locations in China: The National Supercomputing Center (NSCC) in Wuxi China and the University of Tsinghua and the East China Normal University.

    The ASSURE site is open to US Ph.D. students with an interest in computational and data science in the areas of earth systems, drug design, advanced manufacturing, big data and machine learning. Specifically, US citizens or permanent residents, including women and students from underrepresented populations in international STEM research, are invited to participate.

    number of teams that will receive funding for prototyping/proof of concepts supplies,
    coach expense, and exploratory customer market activities. The Simones Center's
    approach to entrepreneurship is experiential and multidisciplinary. RIT is situated
    to pioneer an I-Corps Site because of its history with experiential learning (coop,
    industry relationships, history of practitioners in the classroom etc.) and its
    program diversity. The Simone Center programs integrate technology, design, and
    business perspectives in a holistic manner. Teams simultaneously enter a program
    with formalized training and curriculum and weekly coaching by an experienced
    cohort of industry-based entrepreneurs and product developers. \n\nThis proposal
    provides broader impacts to society and Rochester region in several ways:\n-The
    Creation of Entrepreneurial Assets: RIT will increase the number of graduates
    with an emphasis on STEM and design with business creation/tech commercialization
    knowledge, experience, and teams building skills to innovate throughout their
    careers.\n-New Ventures: The Student Incubator has and will continue to create
    a variety of companies that have growth and provided economic development to the
    struggling Rochester Region. \n-Pipeline Development: RIT will provide a pre-seed/early
    stage pipeline for potential new ventures.  \n-Successful Undergraduate Innovation
    Processes: This program promotes and advances the development of balanced student
    teams, experienced coaching, and access to university support services (prototyping
    labs, faculties, and other expertise). \n-Integration with a Preexisting Business
    Incubator: The Simone Center's programs and events target early stage business
    development. The Simone Center's Student Incubator Program transitions its investment
    ready projects/businesses to the pre-existing RIT Incubator allows each unit to
    focus on the a specific stage of new venture creation. This is also a potential
    process for learning and dissemination.\nThis is a project at an institution that
    serves a very large population of deaf students (the largest population in the
    nation). It has processes in place that will accommodate those and the other RIT
    students to explore entrepreneurship and innovation - 90% of all RIT students
    engage in a co-op experience. The Site design is student-centric, having the joint
    impact of launching innovative products and immersing students in an entrepreneurship
    curriculum. RIT has a track record of successes - in particular, they have a history
    of launching \"game-centric\" and visual media products.\n\n\nThe Site has the
    potential to have a large regional impact in a part of the country that has been
    economically depressed. There is a large team of volunteers willing to mentor
    students as well as an Advisory Board to guide the programs."

- abstractText: |-
    The Shiraki International Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research (SIMuR) project is a collaboration between faculty and students at three public universities (Bridgewater State University, University of California San Diego, and Ilia State University in Georgia) and the National Academy of Sciences of Georgia. The SIMuR project will engage U.S. undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research of historical and ongoing human-environmental interactions in the Shiraki Plateau in the southeastern part of the country of Georgia. The project will strengthen scientific knowledge, technical and leadership skills of a cohort of diverse, globally competent, and engaged young STEM researchers. This international research experience will embed students in a cross-country and cross-disciplinary research effort while getting them acquainted with the national specifics of this culturally-rich strategic region. SIMuR will increase STEM engagement and literacy in underserved communities in rural Georgia and the US, bringing advanced data science, visualization and spatial and temporal analysis concepts and technologies into this cross-country collaboration, thus improving the capacity of students and universities to address research problems of global significance.

    Specifically, understanding the interplay of natural and anthropogenic factors in the history of human settlement on the Shiraki Plateau is a part of the interdisciplinary challenge of identifying and modeling impacts of human and environmental changes influencing the rise and decline of civilizations. With the goal of contributing to this developing body of knowledge, SIMuR will engage 15 undergraduate students from Bridgewater State University (5 students each year) in high-quality interdisciplinary research collaborations with Georgian peers and mentorship from an international group of experts in geological sciences, cyber-archaeology, computer engineering, information management, and data science. Participants will also engage in STEM outreach to underserved communities in southeastern Georgia and Massachusetts. Both the research and educational components of the project will build on a confluence of advanced technologies to clarify the several competing hypotheses of the depopulation of the Shiraki Plateau, the site of a recently discovered early civilization. The active reconsideration of the early human history of this area by the research community, and rapidly growing additional data from archaeological excavations and field observations in geology, hydrology, paleo-ecology and related fields, will make this an unprecedented opportunity for students to engage in the science debate, develop field research and analysis skills, and deepen their understanding of this rapidly developing culturally diverse area. By creating and disseminating findings in accessible online locations, the project will increase equitable access to authentic scientific data to scientists, educators, and underserved communities in US and throughout the world. Recruitment will focus on undergraduate students from groups traditionally underserved in STEM fields, low-income and first-generation college students.

- abstractText: |-
    Functional Morphology and Comparative Anatomy are the studies of how bodies work in humans and other animals, disciplines of research that began and continue, to this day, in the collections in Paris.  In this IRES project, new generations of students will be taught to test hypotheses across species using cutting-edge tools in functional morphology and comparative biology,  subjects that are of interest to the great number of students interested in careers in STEM fields,  thus attempting to inspire this focal 21st Century work-force growth in a place that formed the foundation of the discipline over the last many centuries.  Approximately seven undergraduate students a year will be recruited from diverse backgrounds (including recruitment from colleges and universities that serve historically underrepresented groups) and trained in techniques that span live animal behavior, muscle dissection, analyses of bones, teeth and skulls and finally how to make inferences about the behavior and abilities of extinct species from the shapes of their fossils.  Not only will students learn these technical skills, but through working with senior professors and their international teams of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, they will learn the "soft skills" of collaborating across academic teams and cultures.  Students will gain these skills and earn authorship on professional presentations and potentially publications, giving them the possibly life changing experiences that may form the core of their continued pursuit of STEM interests and careers.

    The overarching goal of this project is to train diverse cohorts of students in burgeoning 21st century functional morphology and comparative anatomy techniques.  Students will be trained in key techniques the US PI's lab (at North Carolina State University) prior to being accompanied to Paris to work in the lab of one of his collaborators at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle where they will have access to centuries-old collections and the other biological research institutions in the region.  There, with the mentorship of the professors and their senior postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, the IRES students will develop independent or group projects that focus on modern approaches to functional morphology and comparative anatomy research questions.  These may include 1) behavioral research and experimentation at several zoological facilities (including access to a colony of mouse lemurs, or work with species like the greater bamboo lemur, that are not held in captivity outside of France), 2) dissection work with fresh specimens or specimens from the museum's expansive fluid collection, and analyses of osteological or dental material from 3) modern species or 4) the famous fossil collections also housed in this historically significant museum collection.  These studies may ultimately allow the IRES students to use this knowledge about the behavior and anatomy of extant species to evaluate the adaptations of extinct species.

- abstractText: "This project will provide international research experience for students
    from the California State University (CSU) system through collaborative research
    projects and educational experience on the ATLAS experiment of the Large Hadron
    Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland.
    This program will send 6 CSU students per year to work on ATLAS research projects
    for ATLAS detector upgrades and incoming ATLAS Run-3 data taking and physics.
    The physics potential of incoming Run-3 will be over 10 times greater than Run-1
    during which the Higgs boson was discovered. The Higgs discovery by ATLAS and
    CMS experiments of LHC in 2012 has captured the attention and imagination of the
    public and students throughout the world. This International Research Experiences
    for Students (IRES) project will support 18 students over three years working
    on ATLAS experiment of LHC at CERN.  This project is focused on the largest university
    system in the country with 23 campuses and a total student population of ~490,000.
    Because CSU has very large minority and first-generation college student populations,
    student recruitment in this project will attract underrepresented as well as female
    students.  \n\nThe CSU students will validate the ATLAS Monte Carlo simulations,
    improve ATLAS software packages, and work on searching for new physics from ATLAS
    data. On ATLAS detector upgrades, the students will work on the installation,
    operation, and data analysis of ATLAS pixel detector, and improving software packages
    in monitoring various inner detector components. On ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition
    (DAQ), the students will install and test Fast Tracker (FTK) boards, improve and
    optimize FTK variable resolution patterns, and conduct offline and online testing
    of FTK performance. The students will also attend the renowned CERN Summer Student
    Lecture Series given by top physicists from all over the world. Upon returning
    to the US, student participants will give colloquia, seminars, and invited talks
    at CSU campuses, high schools, and local communities about their ATLAS research
    work and the CERN summer experience. Through the CSU Fresno PHYS 168S (?Physics
    Outreach?) course, the ATLAS students in PHYS 168S will visit at least two new
    K-12 classrooms each week to teach kinds about the CSU ATLAS and IRES programs
    and encourage them to pursue science. These outreach efforts will reach very large
    number of schools, their students and students? families in the Fresno and Central
    Valley area.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed
    worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit

- abstractText: "Biodiversity loss, climate variability, and pollution are major threats
    to ecosystem functioning and quality of human life. Addressing these human-environment
    interactions is particularly important for tropical forest ecosystems as they
    contain approximately half of all living species, play an important role in climate
    regulation, and filter pollutants from water and air. Despite their importance,
    current policies are still largely ineffective as indicated by continued significant
    tropical forest loss over the past several decades. This NSF International Research
    Experience for Students award will support U.S. student projects across forests
    in Panama, Costa Rica, and Uganda to analyze how international variation in environmental
    policies influences land use practices and how these practices affect conservation
    outcomes related to forest condition and primate biology. By examining similar
    forests with different environmental policies and different forests with similar
    environmental policies, we will be able to evaluate the largescale effectiveness
    of conservation incentives, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES) and
    ecotourism, alongside the effects of agricultural practices linked to deforestation,
    air and water pollution, and biodiversity loss. Through this research program,
    underrepresented students in anthropology, human biology, and the environmental
    sciences will gain international field research experience in collaboration with
    the Organization for Tropical Studies and Makerere University Biological Field
    Station. Students will work closely with local field assistants and communities
    during their research, thus providing multiple opportunities for cultural exchange.
    At the end of the 10-week program, students will present their initial results
    to local communities and host country scholars at a public forum and will be encouraged
    to communicate their final results through peer-reviewed publication and presentations
    at professional conferences. An additional end product associated with this program
    and utilized by the IRES students will be a fully functioning laboratory capable
    of running immunoassays for quantifying primate hormone levels in the field, thus
    transferring scientific knowledge and infrastructure. Results from this research
    program will provide important insight useful to the design of policies for sustaining
    both biodiversity and human livelihoods. \n\nTropical forests are one of the world's
    most important ecosystems, containing at least half of all species, regulating
    climate, purifying air and water, and providing resources for local communities.
    Nonetheless, over the past few decades widespread deforestation has significantly
    reduced the extent of tropical forests, leading to declines in wildlife populations
    that depend on them through habitat loss and fragmentation. Primate populations
    have been especially affected with more than 60% of all species considered vulnerable
    or endangered by the IUCN. Efforts to preserve the remaining forests and threatened
    species dependent on them have largely focused on creating protected areas, such
    as national parks. However, citizens often rely heavily on natural resources for
    subsistence and environmental laws are regularly breached, thus weakening the
    effectiveness of protected areas. As a result, conservation policies have evolved
    from exclusionary protected areas to strategies that focus on local communities
    by providing economic and other incentives. Despite the increasing promotion of
    community-based alternatives by both scholars and practitioners, little evidence
    exists that they are any more effective than protected areas at maintaining forest
    quality or sustaining primate populations. Therefore, this NSF IRES research program
    has two main objectives: 1) To utilize international variation in environmental
    policies that integrate conservation and development objectives, such as payments
    for ecosystem services (PES) and ecotourism, for an analysis of the effectiveness
    of conservation strategies for both protecting tropical forests and their primates
    and maintaining human livelihoods; and 2) To provide international field research
    experience to underrepresented students in anthropology, human biology, and the
    environmental sciences. To meet these objectives, 15 upper level undergraduate
    and early career graduate student projects will examine the extent to which differing
    economic and participatory incentives and agricultural practices influence conservation
    outcomes as measured by on the ground data collected on forest condition (e.g.,
    fragment size, % canopy cover, biomass) and primate biology (i.e., physiology,
    behavior, and population size) across forests in Panama, Costa Rica, and Uganda.
    At these sites, students will survey primate populations using line transects,
    quantify differences in primate behavior, measure primate fecal hormone levels
    with immunoassays, conduct interviews and surveys of local landowners, government
    officials and other stakeholders, and quantify forest characteristics using GIS
    and field methods. Students will also examine the effects of these strategies
    on local community livelihoods and how these effects influence local perception
    of environmental policy. Results from this project will add significantly to the
    knowledge of how economic and participatory incentives can affect conservation
    decisions and outcomes. As a breakdown in socio-environmental systems will negatively
    affect both humans and biodiversity, quantifying the effectiveness of various
    environmental management strategies to maintain biodiversity and local community
    livelihoods is necessary to ensure that these policies are actually meeting their
    sustainability and conservation goals.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    Porous materials are ubiquitous: soils and rocks support habitat and store energy, cementitious materials are the building blocks of infrastructure,  and our body is made of porous tissues. Strikingly, in all of these media, the absence of solid matter, called the porous space, triggers processes that lead to instabilities of the solid structure and/or of the fluid flow. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) site award, titled "Mechanics of Porous Media across Scales - Research Experience in Paris" (MPMS Paris), supports U.S. students for immersion in cutting-edge poromechanics research laboratories in Paris, France. The award aims to expose Georgia Tech students to poromechanics research applied to civil, environmental and biomechanical engineering, to immerse them in the academic culture of leading European institutions based in Paris, and to inspire them in the pursuit of a scientific career to create resistant, sustainable and safe porous materials in response to infrastructure, energy and health demands. IRES participants will do a 10-week research internship in one of several host laboratories at leading partners institutions in Paris under the supervision of dual mentors from Georgia Tech and the MPMS Paris partner. The project includes experienced teams who collaborated on a prior IRES award and teams new to the collaboration. Pre- and post- internship activities will be organized in partnership with Georgia Tech international education programs and the Science and Technology Department at the Consulate General of France in Atlanta. IRES participants will take ownership of a research project in elite engineering laboratories, acquire language skills and have longer exposure to history, technology and society than in a regular curriculum. The integration of activities for faculty and undergraduate and graduate students is expected to sustain long-term collaborations between groups focusing on experimental, theoretical and numerical research in poromechanics.

    Technical description. A multi-scale approach is needed to gain a fundamental understanding of the complex phenomena that occur in porous media subjected to mechanical and environmental solicitations, such as hysteretic flow and adsorption, fracture initiation and propagation, in-pore crystallization and damage development, resin infiltration and tissue restoration. The IRES site will gather a community of scientists including world experts in theoretical poro-mechanics and thermodynamics, from Navier and IFSTTAR at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech (a top European program in applied mathematics and mechanics), MSSMat at Centrale-Supelec (a top European program in mechanical and electrical engineering) and LMS at Ecole Polytechnique (the most selective engineering school in France). Host laboratories are equipped with unique experimental, imaging and material processing facilities and are located on the campuses of French "Grandes Ecoles", which are elite engineering programs. Fundamental research in the physics and mechanics of porous materials will combine cutting-edge simulation tools with advanced experimental and imaging techniques to establish multi-scale models that can capture coupled bio-thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical processes and predict the sustainability and durability of engineered systems. Teams of dual mentors will foster long-term collaborations by working with several cohorts of IRES students on a core research topic. The IRES program will also support travel expenses for mentors to further enhance the student experience and collaborative research activities. The project will support the successful collaborations established through a prior IRES award led by the PI, expand the program to a larger and more diverse group of scholars and ensure a bilateral flow of scholars between Georgia Tech and Paris.

    The objective of this IRES project is to provide U.S. students with international research experience in superconducting electronics and circuits as future computing paradigms in Yokohama National University (YNU), Japan, which has one of the world's strongest research center in superconducting electronics and circuits. The project will select five (5) graduate students and two (2) undergraduate students nation-wide each year and support them to visit YNU over a period of eight (8) weeks. The project will enable U.S. students to conduct high-quality research on next-generation superconducting electronics, in collaboration with their faculty mentors in YNU. Such experiences expose U.S. students to the international research community at a critical early stage in their careers. Through participating in this program, U.S. students will gain extensive experience on the research of superconducting electronics, on the culture in Japan, and on performing and collaborating in an international environment in general. The experience will also be shared to the broader community through the personal social media, Web 2.0 based forum, carefully integrated activities such as research for undergraduate students, minorities and underrepresented groups, as well as outreach events for local schools. It will be beneficial for the STEM and underrepresented student education as well as the advancing of superconducting and semiconductor industry in U.S.

    Being widely-known for low energy dissipation and ultra-fast switching speed, Josephson Junction-based superconductor logic families have been proposed and implemented to process analog and digital signals. It has been perceived to be important candidate to replace state-of-the-art CMOS due to the superior potential in operation speed and energy efficiency. The project contains well-planned recruitment, preparation, mentoring and post-trip activities. The proposed research address fundamental problems in the circuit design, electronic design automation, and applications in superconducting electronics that need to be addressed urgently. The first project deals with the integration of AQFP technology with the efficient implementation of deep learning systems, where the latter is a core research topic in hardware and AI. The second project deals with efficient design of AQFP and RSFQ superconducting circuits and will greatly enhance the performance, efficiency and reliability. The third project aims to develop a design automation toolflow of superconducting electronics, which is currently lacking and will significantly reduce the development time of superconducting circuits. It is anticipated that with the close interaction with YNU, the breakthroughs made from these projects can have a significant impact on future superconducting electronics development and supercomputing systems, as well as the technology in the U.S. in corresponding areas.

- abstractText: "This award supports international research experiences for U.S. undergraduate
    students from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) at the University of Victoria
    (UVic) in Canada in interdisciplinary research representing the fields of bioengineering
    and neuroscience. The project engages primarily Hispanic engineering students
    at UTEP, a majority Hispanic 4-year, public institution. Reciprocal visits to
    UTEP by UVic students will be supported with Canadian funds.  UTEP students will
    be afforded professional development and educational opportunities in cutting-edge
    research.  Specifically, the project engages the synergism of stem cell biology
    with advanced 3-dimensional biomaterial technology to manufacture tissue from
    stem cells. Generating patient-specific \"artificial\" tissue allows the researchers
    to control the rate of growth and differentiation of stem cells.  This research
    is significant in paving the way for modeling disease and for future drug development.
    \ \n\nWorking together, the interdisciplinary team aims to identify unique approaches
    of targeting differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells [iPSCs] into
    neural phenotypes by utilizing advanced materials and processing. Specifically,
    the UTEP team has expertise in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture
    and 3D bioprinting, and UVic has expertise in culturing neuronal differentiation
    of human iPSC on fibrin-based scaffolds. The research focus is the application
    of microfluidic-based 3D bioprinting for coprinting of human iPSCs together with
    biomaterial scaffolds to generate bio-composites of the desired architecture with
    high fidelity. Bioprinting iPSCs with advanced biomaterials and scaffolds bears
    the promise to develop 3D tissues, ideally including encapsulated cells and facilitating
    their proliferation, and targeted differentiation. The project enables addressing
    critical questions in the field: 1) How can advanced materials and their unique
    designs facilitate stem cell culture and promote their differentiation? 2) How
    can 3D bioprinting be applied as an advanced manufacturing technique to mimic
    the complex environment for regulating growth and differentiation of stem cells?
    3) Does the differentiated progeny of cells cultured atop micro-textured scaffolds
    exhibit enhanced functionality and phenotype, compared with controls? Thus, the
    scientific goal is to better understand the role of growth factors and micro-environmental
    niche and cues released from biomaterial scaffolds in the regulation of adult
    human iPSC differentiation into neural phenotypes. It is widely known that distractive
    biomaterial scaffolds that incorporate patterned structures and specific compartments
    of growth factors can more intricately guide stem cell development. Achieving
    this goal enables the ability to address fundamental neurobiological questions
    about neuronal growth, differentiation, which is essential for designing treatments
    for nervous system disorders or traumatic brain injury.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation

    This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) is focused on mapping and quantifying the natural disaster resilience of displaced people in Rwanda. Over a three year period, fourteen U.S. graduate students from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and three undergraduate students from the Monroe Community College Geospatial Information Science and Technology program (MCC) will participate in a ten-week summer research experience at the University of Rwanda Center for Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing (CGIS). Significant activities include student access to and learning from CGIS on displaced population natural disaster resilience issues unique to Rwanda, East African context student research training activities, and access to disaster management organizations focused on displaced people such as the Rwandan Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs (MIDIMAR) only available in Rwanda. The project will create unique linkages to East African organizations that will train, educate and professionally develop 17 STEM student research scientists over three years focused on disaster resilience, displacement and GIS. The project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups as we will fully leverage RIT's existing underrepresented recruitments networks such as RIT's large Deaf-and-Hard of Hearing population, women, and minorities. The MCC student will create a unique opportunity for undergraduate international research experience as well as community college international research capacity development. Displaced people in Rwanda will also benefit through their participation as field research assistants as well as the research providing outreach and advocacy for their situations. Intellectual products created by IRES students, such as community-scale resilience maps displacement resilience indexes will provide important benefits to society that can bring global attention to displacement and disaster resilience research and GIS. The project is particularly strong in enhancing infrastructure for research and education as IRES students will become part of Rwandan and East African research networks only available by being on-site in Rwanda. CGIS and MIDIMAR for the first time become linked to NSF research. Workshops on disasters and resilience GIS mapping will be conducted by IRES students with Rwandan secondary schools and disaster stakeholder groups for broader project outreach. If successful, findings will be generalizable for additional internationally-focused research beyond displaced population natural disaster resilience in Rwanda (for example, the Syrian and Rohingya refugee crises) and particularly US-national interest disaster resilience and displacement issues like seen in hurricanes Harvey and Maria, creating the potential for broader US-national and international research on displaced population natural disaster resilience that can provide future students with the knowledge, motivation and inspiration to pursue internationally-focused science careers to solve US-national and global challenges.

    The primary student research project goal is community-level scale field mapping with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing of resilience indicators relevant to displaced population natural disaster resilience. Data collected by IRES students will be used as an input for spatially modeling, indexing and quantifying the natural disaster resilience of displaced people. The research team will create transformative knowledge on understanding the relationship between displacement and natural disaster resilience. Spatial indexes of displaced population natural disaster resilience currently do not exist at any scale -  let alone at the community-level scale that will only be possible to investigate through the foreign research site. Student research efforts will make valuable intellectual contributions to understanding (a) the spatial relationships between displacement and disaster resilience, (b) how developing displacement disaster resilience spatial metrics can inform displacement planning, and (c) how resilience is developed and manifested in displacement and disaster contexts to inform disaster management decision making and risk-reduction. Rwanda is a unique location for research on mapping and quantifying displaced population natural disaster resilience due to both refugee populations and internally displaced Rwandan citizens who face natural disaster risks. Access to these diverse and unique groups is only possible by being in Rwanda.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This IRES project is co-funded by OISE and EPSCoR.

    Twelve Native American students from five Tribal Colleges in the state of North Dakota will participate in a six-week summer program over the course of three years. Each year, four students will form a cohort and participate in pre-training in the U.S. and then visit and study at the host University in Beijing, China for five weeks. All three student cohorts will focus on one unifying topic - building and testing an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled environmental monitoring system. During the course of the research training and after the project is finished, a deep and comprehensive evaluation will be conducted to assess three key aspects of the program: 1) instructional training and research experience, 2) global professional and cultural experience; and 3) student mentoring. This program will greatly benefit participating students. This is an international learning experience that may be the key highlight of student participants' academic careers, which may be especially true for Native American students, as they have less chances for performing research abroad. The program will provide participating students with unique opportunities to become globally-engaged scientists and to build their international scientific networks. There are five Tribal Colleges in the state of North Dakota that represent historic tribal nations. The recruitment of this program from these Tribal Colleges will ensure a regionally diverse student group will receive international mentoring and research-based education. In many large cities of U.S., there are environmental problems similar to Beijing, so the monitoring technology learned by participating students will provide valuable reference and an essential technology reserve. The participating students will build peer-mentoring skills and learn about the unique culture and traditions of China from Beijing, the culture center of China.

    Student participants will learn to design advanced environmental monitoring systems that integrate energy harvest and remote control, which can track all four categories of environmental contaminants including metals, radioisotopes, volatile organic contaminants, and biological contaminants. In this project, tasks for student participants include sensor developments, interface circuits designs, wireless sensor network designs for Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled systems to realize environmental monitoring, testing the proposed monitoring system on laboratory and field sites, and making reliability-based lifetime analyses. The proposed system is a much-needed technology for environmental decision-making that will help substantially reduce ecological and human-health threats from environmental problems, and the implemented prototype and test data will be a significant reference for the other academic researchers and industrial developers. Evaluation data collection will occur sequentially using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data measurements to assess the effectiveness of the program. The primary goals of this program are to: 1) provide students with training and mentoring in international-based engineering applications that will create a positive effect in their professional and personal lives, 2) create Native American experts in environmental monitoring and protection, and 3) improve specialized environmental management in the remote areas.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    the transformation of the way technical writers and research teams write and edit
    technical documentation, including data dissemination reports, research proposals,
    and journal papers. The new toolset will ensure rapid training, high quality,
    and high levels of innovation in technical and scientific teams. The methodology,
    implemented in software, will target a broad spectrum of users, from seasoned
    technical writing teams to emerging solo practitioners; the training materials
    built into the system will be beneficial for all students and young technical
    writers who seek to develop more effective writing approaches. The market segmentation
    is broken into, in the order of market size: 1) large businesses and corporations,
    2) academia and educational institutions, 3) government agencies, 4) individuals,
    and 5) small businesses. Commercialization will require securing partnerships
    with marketers, university personnel, scholarly journals, and industry professionals,
    as well as conducting case studies and customer discovery to quantify how the
    product saves teams time, reduces stress, and delivers training materials for
    personnel. The resulting product will facilitate the development of strong professional
    manuscripts for teams of all sizes at other universities and in the industry.
    \n\nThis I-Corps project seeks to simplify and automate some of the critical obstacles
    to technical writing, thereby fostering a time-efficient writing and editing environment.
    In the current collaborative technical writing paradigm, personnel training and
    inexperience are two of the biggest obstacles to successful (in terms of acceptance
    rates) technical documentation. Teams that adopt the new writing and editing toolset
    will find it easier to train new personnel, as well as coordinate writing efforts
    across a variety of different writing styles and skills. Senior researchers will
    have more time and resources to focus on the research itself, due to the optimized
    method of personnel training or mentorship allowed by this system. Over time,
    the toolset will develop into a methodology that can be broadened to help with
    any writing discipline, from science and engineering to law or accounting. The
    toolset was born out of the needs of academic technical writing teams, which produce
    academic documentation daily. Quantification of impact is segment-dependent. Existing
    case studies show an improved success of proposal submissions by 40%, with a 60%
    increase in writing efficiency without loss of quality (in fact, with improved
    quality, as indicated by the greater success of proposal acceptance).\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."

    This project will enable cohorts of students from engineering, anthropology, and other sustainability-related disciplines to collaborate and study the efficacy of sanitation and wastewater treatment technologies as well as the role of culture and local perceptions on the safe recovery of energy, nutrients, and clean water from human excreta and wastewater. Over the course of three years, a total of 18 US students will be supported to study the performance of different technologies at the Center for Research and Training in Sanitation (CePTS) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. This facility, which is co-managed by the Federal University of Minas Gerais and the State Wastewater Company of Minas Gerais, contains pilot-scale reactors that treat real wastewater from the city of Belo Horizonte. Considered one of the most important research and professional training centers of its kind in the Americas, it is used as a test site to evaluate the effectiveness of new technologies and train wastewater system operators. In addition to broadening students' perspectives about sanitation, resource recovery, and risk within an interdisciplinary team setting, this project will also allow students to improve their intercultural abilities. The researchers will seek to recruit students that reflect our demographics as Title V Hispanic Serving Institutions, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups in the sciences and engineering. Students will participate in a five-day intensive crash course on Brazilian culture and Portuguese language, led by the San Diego State University Program on Brazil, where they will learn to articulate the opinions and perspectives of people from different cultures and backgrounds. They will gain an awareness of international, interdisciplinary, and community perspectives on the role of engineering and technology in the management of water, energy, and food systems. After participating in the research experience, students will share their experiences by engaging in local outreach activities at K-12 schools in Southern California.

    The integration of water reuse and resource recovery into wastewater treatment and sanitation systems provides opportunities to simultaneously meet several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, the challenges of choosing appropriate and sustainable technologies are just as much social as they are technical. Inadequate assumptions about local attitudes and the role of technology in development can lead to the failure of systems. Thus, there is a need to integrate studies of the efficacy of sanitation and resource recovery technologies with assessments of social and cultural factors that influence perceptions about these technologies, as well as the perceived value and risk of recovering resources from wastewater and excreta. This three-year International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will send interdisciplinary cohorts of six students each year (from Engineering, Anthropology and an interdisciplinary Sustainability Program) to Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to participate in a research experience with foreign mentorship at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). Students will study the removal of emerging contaminants and characterize the risks associated with resource recovery from pilot-scale established and emerging wastewater treatment technologies at the Center for Research and Training in Sanitation (CePTS), which is co-managed by UFMG and the State Wastewater Company of Minas Gerais. Students will also investigate perceived values and risks through ethnographic research with community members and local stakeholders in the water and wastewater sector. The results of this research will support a new and growing field of interdisciplinary scientific literature on the topic of water, culture, and sustainability.

    Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable data for carbon cycling modelling
    at the local, regional and even global scale. Students will test the hypothesis
    that anthropogenic pollution in the Douala Estuary increases bio-productivity
    in the water column and sediments, alters the cycling of carbon and increases
    the flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. \n\nBy interacting with Cameroonian
    peers, the US students will enrich their cultural experience, build personal and
    professional networks and establish relationships that will form the core of future
    international research collaborations. Finally, the results of student projects
    will provide scientific input that is useful for designing sustainable management
    programs for the use and protection of estuarine resources.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The first stars, galaxies and black holes burst into existence only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, bringing light to the cosmos and setting in motion processes that built the Universe as we see it today. Many mysteries remain about these early epochs, but not for too much longer: new and upcoming facilities such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and the James Webb Space Telescope are optimized to revolutionize our understanding of this time period, known as "Cosmic Dawn." The Cosmic Dawn Center of Excellence (DAWN, established 2018), an international research center in Copenhagen, Denmark, brings together scholars whose interests span a broad range of observational and theoretical inquiries into Cosmic Dawn. Their expertise, together with Copenhagen's beautiful and enriching setting, make DAWN an ideal host for budding US scholars. We will create the DAWN-IRES Scholars Program to empower future generations of US scientists through a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of visiting Copenhagen to immerse themselves into this vibrant international research center. The DAWN-IRES scholars will join a cohort of 7 student researchers in a stimulating 10-week science program that merges research using next-generation telescopes with life in a thousand-year-old city. The program's structure will encourage students to build learning communities within their cohorts, equipping them with practical research and communication skills. At the same time, the international exposure and access to cutting-edge resources will help maintain US leadership within the global astronomical community.

    Students will lead observational and/or theoretical projects that contribute towards understanding some of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics today: What caused the reionization of the Universe?  How do the first, massive galaxies form?  What is the origin of galaxy scaling relations? What quenches star formation in massive galaxies?  Over the next decade, the center's mission is to develop and test a physical model explaining the key processes responsible for the assembly of the earliest galaxies through to the present day. The DAWN-IRES Scholars will join this thriving international research network, bridging the world class research performed by the US-based associate faculty coordinating this program with the DAWN permanent faculty and the local program coordinator.  The key learning goals of this international research experience include: (1) building a learning community to stimulate personal and academic growth, (2) developing effective scientific communication skills, and (3) performing globally competitive research addressing an open question in astrophysics.

    The DAWN-IRES program is primarily designed to enhance the progress of science through a unique global educational training experience for a diverse cohort of US students.  The themes defining the broader impact of the program include diversity, training, dissemination, and community.  Through extensive proactive recruitment strategies (direct contact with faculty at minority-serving institutions, leveraging social media, widely circulating flyers, local announcements in STEM courses, and more), the PI will assemble diverse groups of scholars to stimulate excellence and innovation.  The program incorporates a wide range of professional development activities that are focused on advancing scientific communication skills (e.g., weekly seminars, hack days, oral presentations abroad and stateside).  The students will also build professional research toolkits, including learning programming, data analysis and presentation techniques.  Dissemination of research will occur through the DAWN-IRES Scholars Symposium at the end of each summer in Copenhagen, together with a presentation at the students' local institutions and the national American Astronomical Society meeting.  Working with the Center for Excellence in Teaching at UConn, the assessment strategy of DAWN-IRES will be tailored to the learning goals of the program.

    Fungal infection of plants is an ongoing major threat to human agriculture, thus stressing the importance of the research proposed in this project. The fungal pathogens studied in the US lab of the PI and the two labs in Germany, serve as models for understanding basic mechanisms of infections, but also for understanding host specificity and emerging infectious disease through host shifts. It is expected to gain alternative perspectives to address these research themes by the collaborative approaches. This IRES project provides an opportunity to 7 students each year to participate in the exchange. Although all three labs work with fungi, each has its own areas of expertise and each provides different approaches for conducting research. Each summer, a joint meeting will take place with all participants and PIs to discuss and present the ongoing projects in a unified group setting, alternating each year in Bochum or in Aachen, Germany.  This project is of particular importance because it may lead to the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from fungal diseases. Also, this project will allow active participation by students and help them develop skills in experimental design, and broaden participation in basic science by underrepresented groups (especially, African-Americans, women, and Appalachian students).

    The unifying research theme for this proposal is host/pathogen interaction, including components of virulence and overall fitness of the pathogen. This project requires, and will benefit from, training in the two German labs, rather than having all students work in the same lab. First, the collaboration with two labs spreads the responsibility of the host labs and allows for more students (i.e., up to 7) to participate each year in the exchange. It is expected that the strong impact of these collaborative research/training exchanges will be in the longer-term appreciation of cultural differences and alternative approaches to research questions. The broader investigation of fungal/host interactions will benefit from this varied, collaborative approach by streamlining exchange of ideas and expertise. The proposed effector and protein interaction studies will be used by a wide community of scientists interested in basic fungal biology, host-parasite interactions, fungal evolution, and the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from fungal diseases and could lead to a better understanding of the basic infection mechanisms and disease process of obligate plant-parasitic fungi. Educational opportunities for students will be provided to actively participate in fungal genetics, transcriptomics and bio-informatics research, to learn fluorescence and electron microscopy techniques, to develop skills in experimental design, and will broaden the participation in basic science by underrepresented groups (specifically, African-Americans, women, and Appalachian students).

    Center for Selective Carbon - Hydrogen (C-H) Functionalization (CCHF) will coordinate and support a highly collaborative international exchange program with sites in Japan, South Korea and Germany. During the exchanges, students will participate in collaborative projects directed towards developing new approaches to making molecules in a streamlined and sustainable way. These new approaches will have impact on modern medicine and manufacturing, including drug discovery and materials science. This proposal builds upon a previous NSF Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) program and provides the exciting opportunity to capitalize on the collaborative bonds already established to grow a truly diverse and globally prepared next generation of scientists that benefit from an integrated and successful global research collective. The overarching scientific theme that brings these international teams together is C-H functionalization, a science that is at the leading edge of academic chemical research.

    The aim of this International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) proposal is to establish a vibrant training environment for collaborative global research in the general field of C?H functionalization. This will be achieved by means of a productive international research collaborative, the Global Institute for C-H Functionalization (GICHF).  This program will involve student exchanges and collaborations between the CCHF and three major international centers in the general field of C-H functionalization.  These centers are the World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI)-funded Institute for Transformative Bio-Molecule (WPI-ITbM) at Nagoya University, Japan, the Institutes for Basic Sciences-funded Center for Catalytic Hydrocarbon Functionalizations (IBS-CF) at KAIST, South Korea, and the Photocatalysis Center based at the University of Regensburg, Germany.  Each year a cohort of CCHF students, consisting of 3 graduate and 5 undergraduate students will perform 8-12 week exchanges between May-August with the international partners. The CCHF will also host international students, funded by the international partners, to ensure reciprocity in the collaborative exchanges.  Programming throughout the year will be in place to prepare the students for the research exchanges and to ensure they make the most of these experiences. The experience will include a GICHF annual meeting, which will be hosted, on a rotating basis, at one of our international partners. The annual meeting will serve as an opportunity to bring together the entire student cohort as well as faculty from the United States, for a week-long brainstorming, community building, and educational event with our international partners.

    International Research and Professional Development Experience for Students on the Ecology and Conservation of Wildlife in Nosy Be, Madagascar

    The proposed research and professional development program will take place in Madagascar, one of the highest priority biodiversity hotspots in the world, with levels of endemism unmatched by any other country. The research goal of this program is to characterize the status of Nosy Be Island's endangered and charismatic terrestrial and marine species and identify the threats driving their declines. The research team of local and international researchers will train undergraduate students from the US and Madagascar to use a variety of wildlife research methods and social science surveys. Using these acquired skills, students will generate critical data on the conservation status of endangered marine and terrestrial species, including primates (lemurs), sea turtles, and dolphins. During this 3-year project students will, along with mentor, develop an understanding of the drivers of wildlife declines and design sustainable programs to protect them.  Science-based management is particularly important in Madagascar because terrestrial and marine ecosystems are experiencing alarming rates of biodiversity loss and habitat destruction in the face of food security challenges to local human populations. This project will create opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from both countries to adapt field methods to research questions in the context of generating cost-effective data to achieve sustainable conservation goals. Most importantly, this program will produce cohorts of highly trained scientists in the field of conservation biology with a deep understanding of real-world challenges.

    Generating baseline ecological data on rare and charismatic endangered species is critical for conservation and wildlife management, particularly in data-poor areas where conflicts between human activities and biodiversity are acute. All research projects will address at least one of three objectives: (1) assess the critical habitats and density trends of six endangered flagship species, including three lemurs, one species of cetacean and one species of sea turtle, (2) investigate the environmental drivers of their abundance and their decline, and (3) assess the impact of potential mitigation measures. Each cohort of students (6 students per year) will base their research questions on the findings of previous cohorts, enabling us to develop a comprehensive understanding of the causes of decline and measures to preserve Nosy Be's wildlife. This research and professional development program has four stages: 1) pre-field training at Florida International University, 2) data collection in Madagascar, 3) data-analysis and reporting at FIU and 4) future-cohort input and supervision where students will share their experiences and support new cohorts. During field activities, students will be trained to 1) use standard methods to rapidly assess the conservation status of endangered species in the field and 2) use a combination of field and social science survey methods to conduct animal assessments. During class activities students will be trained to 1) write research proposals and field protocols, 2) use advanced statistical methods to analyze field data, 3) write technical and non-technical publications, 4) do oral presentations of their research, and 5) collaborate and mentor other students. Ultimately, this research program will provide critical data on the conservation status of endangered marine and terrestrial wildlife in Nosy Be, Madagascar, and will provide students with key research and conservation skills.

    and education partnership between the University of Michigan (U-M) and University
    of Bologna (UniBo) in Italy.  The proposed work is envisioned to improve the quality-of-life
    of people with disabilities and their caregivers, transform the knee-ankle-foot-orthosis
    care to data-based diagnosis and model-based design and 3D-printing, and provide
    an international research experience to students. The goal of this collaboration
    is to provide a high-quality international research experience to University of
    Michigan students to increase student diversity and retention and advance students'
    ability in and knowledge of culture, globalization, leadership, teamwork, and
    communication. The key intellectual merit of this collaboration is in the model-based
    design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of individualized assistive devices. The project
    will utilize technical knowledge gained from University of Michigan and will improve
    individualized assistive devices such as the knee-ankle-foot orthosis, a brace
    that helps people with leg instabilities to walk. \n\nThe scientific objective
    of this award is to establish an international research and education partnership
    between the University of Michigan (U-M) and University of Bologna (UniBo) in
    Italy on the model-based design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of individualized
    assistive devices (IADs). The project is focused on the advancements in 3D-printing
    and wearable sensors that enable the design and fabrication of assistive devices
    for individual needs.  Patient-specific biomechanical models will be developed
    to analyze the motions and forces associated with the daily activities of a patient.
    For example, from models of patient-specific knee joint motion, compliant 3D-printed
    knee joints will be analyzed and designed to improve the function of individual
    assistive devices.  Combined metal 3D-printing, precision machining, and mechanical
    testing will be used to fabricate and test the compliant knee joint.  Finally,
    the knee-ankle-foot-orthosis devices fabricated by conventional and 3D-printing
    methods will be evaluated on patients in clinic and during daily activities. Specifically,
    this project aims to design, fabricate, and evaluate an individualized knee-ankle-foot-orthosis
    (KAFO) with metal and plastic 3D-printed parts. Students will study four research
    topics related to the KAFO: (1) biomechanical quantification of activities and
    lifestyles of KAFO patients, (2) analysis and design of a patient-specific compliant
    knee joint, (3) manufacturing of compliant knee joint, and (4) evaluation of the
    patient-specific KAFO.\n\nThe broader impact of the proposed work in design, 3D-printing,
    and evaluation of personalized assistive devices is to re-establish the quality-of-life
    of people with disabilities by restoring normal joint motion and function. Personalized
    assistive devices with good fit and quick delivery can greatly benefit patients
    as well as their caregivers. Further, tailoring the function of these devices
    to the patient improves their ability to ambulate and reduces the chances of reinjury.
    The transformative aspects of this project are the mass production of custom assistive
    devices and the long-term monitoring of the gait and mobility of assistive device
    users for physical and psychological diagnosis and prevention of fall and other
    accidents. The knowledge and biomechanical models can improve the design practice
    and evaluation of the efficacy of a broad range of assistive devices.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    drinking water and adequate sanitation. Although there have been a number of efforts
    to develop low-cost, efficient methods to treat water and wastewater, many of
    them fail in practice due to the lack of understanding of social and economic
    factors, and the lack of community engagement. This project will engage fifteen
    (15) IRES participants and three (3) graduate assistants from STEM, STEM education,
    public health and social sciences in carrying out research to develop, test and
    implement the technologies, such as biosand filters and decentralized sanitation
    systems, while uncovering and addressing social factors that limit their use in
    the field. The project will take place in collaboration with students and faculty
    at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), as well as teachers
    and pupils in a local secondary school in Kumasi, Ghana.  US students will experience
    real on-the-ground water and sanitation situations that will enhance their research
    skills as they develop the global competence needed to work effectively in developing
    countries.  Specific objectives are to: 1) increase the number of US students
    engaging in global water and sanitation research, 2) enhance student understanding
    of the complexity of water and sanitation challenges and increase their global
    competency, 3) engage secondary school teachers and pupils in Ghana in authentic
    science and participatory action research, and 4) develop strong collaborations
    between USF and KNUST for water and sanitation research and education.\n\nThe
    participating research teams will advance research and development of: 1) biosand
    filters that simultaneously address infectious disease and dental/skeletal health
    risks that are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, and 2) decentralized ecological
    sanitation technologies, such as constructed wetlands, urine diverting dry toilets
    and biodigesters, which recover valuable resources (water, nutrients, energy)
    from human wastes.  Each team will work on technology development, appropriate
    financing mechanisms and effective behavioral and educational approaches to improve
    WASH practices. \n\nIRES participants will directly experience WASH research in
    the geopolitical, socioeconomic and cultural context of Ghana.  These experiences
    will enhance their understanding of WASH challenges and build their global competency.
    \ We will recruit female and underrepresented minority students through programs

- abstractText: "Materials scientists from the University of Vermont will partner
    with engineers and physicists at Yamagata University (Japan) for an IRES program
    that will foster and nurture a new generation of interdisciplinary materials scientists.
    At the end of the program participants will be equipped with key experimental
    skills and background tailored for the specific needs of organic electronics research
    and technology that bridge physical chemistry, chemical engineering, and condensed
    matter physics. Three PhDs and twelve undergraduate US students will spend ten
    weeks working in teams with the Japanese mentors and their students on interdisciplinary
    projects specifically designed to leverage the ongoing collaboration on small
    molecules electronics between the US and Japanese participants. The students will
    learn specific experimental techniques while immersed in a new, culturally -distinct
    collaborative environment. They will gain unprecedented access to fabrication
    and characterization techniques inaccessible at their home institution. Students
    will undergo a two-week intensive language training specifically focused on laboratory
    work communication and become part of the cultural immersion activities at Yamagata
    University. The group also benefits from the contribution of a school of education
    faculty member that will conduct assessment activities resulting in best practices
    recommendations for a Global Scientist certificate offering at the University
    of Vermont.  A semester -long recruitment plan will focus on women and minorities
    from small or HBCU colleges in the northeastern United States.\n\nFor the past
    ten years, synthetic chemistry efforts that produced soluble derivatives of small
    molecule semiconductors led to macroscopically-ordered crystalline thin films
    and scalable, cost-effective roll-to-roll processing techniques that promise a
    future where flexible, bio-integrated, or disposable electronics may play a significant
    role in our everyday lives. Though these advances have been incredibly significant,
    the performance metrics of organic semiconductor-based transistors, LEDs, and
    solar cells are still far behind (to varying degrees) their crystalline inorganic
    counterparts.  The scientific and engineering communities are at a turning point
    where the next major step forward can only be realized with novel interdisciplinary
    approaches based on a fundamental understanding of the electronic and excitonic
    properties. \nThe Vermont -Yamagata IRES partnership will foster and nurture a
    new generation of interdisciplinary materials scientists, that will become experts
    ready to tackle the grand challenges of small molecule electronics. The underlying
    scientific theme of the student projects investigates correlations between long-range
    order, the nature of intermolecular interactions, and electronic properties in
    small molecule families. It seeks ways of exploiting these correlations towards
    establishing design rules for optimization of electronic and excitonic properties
    of small molecule thin films. Such design rules lead to avenues for affordable,
    sustainable, organic device platforms for a variety of applications including
    photovoltaics, flexible electronics, and bio-interfacing. The proposed experimental
    work will also trigger theoretical questions related to bridging the quantum chemistry
    body of knowledge with condensed matter approaches that take into account long
    range interactions, thus building an interdisciplinary model for excitonic and
    charge carrier behavior in these systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

- abstractText: "This IRES project provides experiences for 4-6 undergraduate researchers
    from the University of San Diego and Harvey Mudd College to spend 8-10 weeks researching
    brown carbon formation by aqueous photooxidation of atmospheric phenolic compounds.
    Four weeks of research will be conducted onsite at Universit? Paris Est ? Cr?teil
    (UPEC), where the cohort of undergraduate researchers will closely collaborate
    with their international mentors on a series of CESAM aerosol chamber experiments
    utilizing advance spectroscopic methods. After returning from France, the undergraduate
    research team will focus on the workup, interpretation, and presentation of chamber
    data, while continuing to interact with international mentors via video conferencing.
    Each participant will be involved in the project for at least one semester prior
    and two semesters subsequent to travel for training and further experimentation
    at their U.S. campuses. In total, 15 undergraduates over 3 years will participate
    in this international project and will be mentored by French scientists while
    gaining hands-on experience with advanced research tools. \nThis IRES project
    is focused on atmospheric chemistry and will contribute to the better understanding
    of clean air and global warming.\n\nPhenolic compounds, which are produced during
    biomass burning and from the oxidation of anthropogenic aromatic precursors, are
    believed to be significant sources of brown carbon aerosol when oxidized in cloud
    droplets, especially in the presence of iron (from dust) or nitrogen oxides (from
    combustion pollution).  However, multi-phase reactions of phenolic compounds have
    been studied mainly in bulk aqueous solutions rather than in more realistic nanodroplets,
    where photobleaching can become photobrowning and where reactivity is often accelerated,
    especially for surface-active oligomerizing species. The researchers will therefore
    study brown secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation by phenolic precursor species
    in nanodroplet \"cloud simulation\" photooxidation experiments at the CESAM chamber
    in Paris, characterizing chemical and optical changes in aerosol particles before,

  title: 'Collaborative Research: RUI: IRES - Track I: Brown Carbon Aerosol Formation
    by Photooxidation of Phenolic Compounds in Nanodroplets'
- abstractText: "This IRES project provides experiences for 4-6 undergraduate researchers
    from the University of San Diego and Harvey Mudd College to spend 8-10 weeks researching
    brown carbon formation by aqueous photooxidation of atmospheric phenolic compounds.
    Four weeks of research will be conducted onsite at Universite Paris Est-Creteil
    (UPEC), where the cohort of undergraduate researchers will closely collaborate
    with their international mentors on a series of CESAM aerosol chamber experiments
    utilizing advance spectroscopic methods. After returning from France, the undergraduate
    research team will focus on the workup, interpretation, and presentation of chamber
    data, while continuing to interact with international mentors via video conferencing.
    Each participant will be involved in the project for at least one semester prior
    and two semesters subsequent to travel for training and further experimentation
    at their U.S. campuses. In total, 15 undergraduates over 3 years will participate
    in this international project and will be mentored by French scientists while
    gaining hands-on experience with advanced research tools. \nThis IRES project
    is focused on atmospheric chemistry and will contribute to the better understanding
    of clean air and global warming.\n\nPhenolic compounds, which are produced during
    biomass burning and from the oxidation of anthropogenic aromatic precursors, are
    believed to be significant sources of brown carbon aerosol when oxidized in cloud
    droplets, especially in the presence of iron (from dust) or nitrogen oxides (from
    combustion pollution).  However, multi-phase reactions of phenolic compounds have
    been studied mainly in bulk aqueous solutions rather than in more realistic nanodroplets,
    where photobleaching can become photobrowning and where reactivity is often accelerated,
    especially for surface-active oligomerizing species. The researchers will therefore
    study brown secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation by phenolic precursor species
    in nanodroplet \"cloud simulation\" photooxidation experiments at the CESAM chamber
    in Paris, characterizing chemical and optical changes in aerosol particles before,
    during, and after cloud events. Particle browning will be monitored by CAPS-ssa
    and UV/visible spectroscopy of water-soluble OA as the reactants interact with
    seed aerosol, water droplets, and simulated sunlight in the pressure, temperature,

    Nanoscience is one of the most exciting areas of modern research stretching across the whole spectrum of science including: physics, engineering, chemistry, medicine and health. Computational Nanoscience addresses the challenges of this rapidly evolving field by using novel computational methods to tackle practical problems.

    The main objective of this project is to create international research opportunity for students and immerse them in creative computational nanoscience projects. Through the international research experience,  students will become part of a new generation of computational scientists modeling outstanding problems in materials science, physics and chemistry as researchers in industry, academia, and government labs. To achieve this, students will be trained in both theoretical and practical aspects of computational modeling, and further their professional development through participation in computational projects in an international research environment. The international research framework will allow students to be practitioners and innovators in computational modeling by educating them in both fundamentals (mathematics, physics, computational tools, material science and computer science) and applications.  The students will have opportunity to do research in Japan's leading research center (Tsukuba Science City), world renowned National Lab (RIKEN) and best university (University of Tokyo) and will have access to the world's best supercomputers. In addition, the students will be exposed to Japan's multifaceted culture, traditions, history and natural beauty.

    The proposed research presents broad training opportunities for students overarching physics, electrical engineering, material science, quantum mechanical simulations, high performance computing, and novel computational algorithms. The proposed international collaboration
    will provide an unparalleled research environment for students, exposing them to the forefront of scientific challenges and technological innovations from an international podium. The projects will encourage the participation of underrepresented groups by leveraging the Vanderbilt-Fisk bridge program and by actively recruiting minority students. The students will also be introduced into the
    rich culture and history of Japan. The host Japanese groups will also likely to benefit not only from the research outcomes but through the international cultural exchange and experience.

    The US students will pursue time-dependent simulations of electron and ion dynamics in nanomaterials using novel atomistic quantum mechanical approaches. These investigations will be frontier applications of time-dependent first-principles quantum mechanical calculations to describe interaction of electromagnetic fields and matter, electron transport and scattering and physics of ultracold atoms. The results of these simulations will be valuable in evaluating the experiments probing new frontiers of material science.

    In collaboration with Japanese research groups, researchers from VU have developed a linear scaling atomistic approach to simulate the time-dependent behavior of molecules, solids, and nanostructures in time-dependent external fields. The approach allows for the simulation of electron and ion dynamics in systems containing thousands of atoms, incorporating the effect of electromagnetic fields by coupling the time-dependent Maxwell and Schrodinger equations. The participating students will use these computer simulations tools to study various systems, including high harmonics generation in solids, interaction of laser pulses and 2D materials, ionization and fragmentation of molecules by circularly polarized light, low energy scattering of electrons and biomolecules, and other interesting cases. The students will also develop and test novel computational approaches to increase the speed and accuracy of quantum simulations.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

- abstractText: "The objective of this project is to provide U.S. students with valuable
    research experience related to battery-less embedded systems in future Internet
    of Things (IoT) in China, which has one of the world's largest electronic industry
    and market. The project will select five (5) graduate students and two (2) undergraduate
    students nation-wide each year and support them to visit Tsinghua University (THU)
    over a period of eight (8) weeks. \n\nThe vision of IoT is to embed small computers
    into objects around our daily life to improve our economy and societal well-being.
    It is estimated that the Internet of Things (IoT) will consist of almost 50 billion
    objects by 2020. However, one of the biggest challenges is how to power these
    billions of embedded devices since batteries need frequent recharging and impose
    health and environmental concerns. In this project, the students will work with
    renowned research groups at THU to develop future IoT sensors that can reply on
    energy harvested from ambient environment sources, such as solar energy, radio
    frequency energy, kinetic energy, and thermal energy. Since ambient energy is
    intrinsically intermittent, the students will conduct research on nano-scale device,
    circuits, system, and software to realize computer systems that can work with
    intermittent energy supply. Such systems will dramatically improve our capability
    of collecting data while reducing the maintenance costs. Potential applications
    include smart healthcare, smart building and infrastructure monitoring, smart
    environmental monitoring, etc. This IRES project will not only offer U.S. students
    an opportunity to work in one of the best engineering research universities in
    China, but also fully immerse them in a foreign environment and improve their
    talents in working with a global team. \n\nThe project contains well-planned recruitment,
    preparation, mentoring and post-trip activities. The proposed research targets
    at nano-scale device, circuits, system, and software issues in battery-less embedded
    systems that need to be addressed urgently. The first project aims to develop
    fast, energy efficient, and uniform write operations for nano-scale memory device,
    which is critical to tolerate intermittency of harvested energy. The project addresses
    a fundamental inconsistency issue when the NVP is interacting with external volatile
    peripheral devices, which is one of the most imminent roadblocks towards wide
    application of NVPs. \nThe second project addresses a fundamental inconsistency
    issue when the battery-less device is collecting data and communicating with external
    devices. The project aims to develop efficient and accurate binarized neural network
    for individual ultraviolet (UV) exposure pattern recognition system running on
    nonvolatile IoT platform, which could be generalized to many other applications.
    \n The third project aims to develop efficient and accurate artificial intelligence
    for individual ultraviolet (UV) exposure pattern recognition system running on
    battery-less IoT platform, which could be generalized to many other applications.
    It can be anticipated that with the close interaction with THU and the Beijing
    Innovation Center for Future Chips, the breakthroughs made from these projects
    can have a direct impact on future IoT market.\n\nThe project will enable U.S.
    students to conduct high-quality research on realizing battery-less embedded systems,
    in collaboration with their faculty mentors in THU. Such experiences expose U.S.
    students to the international research community at a critical early stage in
    their careers. It is expected that through participating in this program, U.S.
    students will gain extensive experience on the\nresearch of embedded computer
    systems, on the culture of China, and on performing and collaborating in an international
    environment in general. The experience will also be shared to the broader community
    through the personal social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube, Web2.0
    based forum, carefully integrated activities such as research for undergraduate
    students, minorities and underrepresented groups, as well as outreach events for
    local K-12 schools.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been
    deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual

    The fundamental goals of this proposal are increasing the diversity of students studying environmental science and training the next generation of global scientists. US students will work in collaborative teams with scientists from UMBC and the Bahamas to study the critically endangered Bahama Oriole. Six students per year will work with mentors doing international research in the Bahamas, followed by data analysis and presentation back at UMBC. These projects will enable students to develop deep understanding of a range of topics in environmental science related to island ecosystems, extinction and climate dynamics. Island ecosystems have always been vulnerable to human impacts, and many island species are endangered or have become extinct. The islands of the Caribbean represent a biodiversity hotspot that is acutely threatened by climate variations. The Caribbean is home to fifteen endangered songbird species, including the critically endangered Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi). The proposed student research experience is a collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and The Bahamas National Trust (BNT) to determine the status of the Bahama Oriole and to understand how habitat and climate change may affect it.

    In the current global extinction crisis, islands are especially vulnerable, and most endangered and extinct avian species are (or were) island species. The Bahama Oriole is now restricted to Andros, having been extirpated from Abaco in the 1990s. The likely threats facing the Bahama Oriole are typical for island species, ranging from introduced predators to anthropogenic habitat change. The impacts of climate change on endemic species in the Caribbean may be especially intense drying and warming are altering fire regimes while rising sea levels and increased hurricane intensity are causing forest mortality. The proposed student research projects address the full scope of these issues facing this critically endangered songbird. Teams of Bahamian and US mentors will together advise undergraduate students on a series of independent research projects. One UMBC PhD student will be continually on-site in the Bahamas to help mentor the students. Student projects will teach the students skills that can be applied in a range of STEM careers. Project topics include 1) population ecology (e.g., estimating population size), 2) remote sensing (e.g., effects of climate change on pine habitat), and 3) predation (e.g., radio tracking to study annual survival). Recently, the research team conducted two pilot trips with diverse teams of students from UMBC and The Bahamas. These student-led efforts confirmed the feasibility of these projects and demonstrated how little is known about the Bahama Oriole.

    Human activities have dramatically altered natural ecosystems, causing the sixth mass extinction event of our planet's history. To curb this unprecedented loss of biological diversity, it is critical to understand how organisms respond to and persist in such rapidly-changing environments. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will explore how natural populations survive the challenges of their natural environment, and then leverage this understanding to determine how the same populations respond to novel human-mediated changes. This IRES project, therefore, will provide insights needed to slow the current, unprecedented loss of biodiversity.

    This IRES project will train cohorts of 10 undergraduate students, targeting those underrepresented in STEM (i.e., women and minorities), for a period of six weeks each year in field research and conservation science in the remote Solomon Islands. The Solomon Islands serve as an ideal setting for this IRES project, as the archipelago is composed of dynamic ecosystems where organisms face constantly-changing conditions caused by both natural and anthropogenic processes. An international team from the University of Miami and local non-government organizations will lead the program, offering diverse perspectives and unique expertise to create a thriving environment for student mentorship. The major goal is for students to first leverage natural systems by executing group experiments that explore how populations meet the challenges of their natural environment. Students will then expand on this understanding of natural systems by developing independent projects to test how the same populations respond to human-mediated disturbances. A follow-up course in the US will provide additional training and career development, with the goal of publishing the student projects. The result is an IRES program where a diverse, international team will equip the next generation of scientists with a more global perspective to tackle our planet's most pressing challenges.

    This IRES project has two major broader impacts. First, this project will train undergraduate students in international research and conservation, targeting those underrepresented in STEM (i.e., women and minorities). This IRES project will therefore tackle the lack of diversity in STEM, and provide international experience that is critical for preparing students to compete in a global market. Second, this IRES project will help establish conservation initiatives in a biodiversity hotspot. The conservation initiative includes students working with local stakeholders in collecting field data and conducting outreach to empower local communities in establishing sustainable practices. By collecting baseline data, students involved in this IRES project will help in the establishment of an ambitious conservation area. This IRES project, therefore, addresses a fundamental question in Biology, while providing students with experience in initiating impactful conservation programs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable the commercialization of the carbon dots technology, with the initial focus on uses in high-performance sensors for water and food analyses and in imaging techniques for the early detection of cancers and other biomedical applications. Carbon dots have been developed as nontoxic and environmentally benign alternatives to the commercially available semiconductor quantum dots, which are nanomaterials of excellent optical properties but mostly containing highly toxic heavy metals in order to achieve the desired properties and performance levels. With similarly excellent properties and high performance, carbon dots as carbon-based nanomaterials can be produced from abundant and environmentally friendly precursors. They are benign and nontoxic.  Because of the low-cost nature, the carbon dots technology is also expected to have broader applications beyond the initial focus for many other societal needs.

    This I-Corps project assesses the market potential and the likely customer base for a carbon dots technology. Carbon dots have emerged as a rapidly advancing and expanding field of research and development. Under the umbrella of the carbon dots technology, significant applications in a number of technological areas have been explored, including carbon dots as extremely sensitive, yet benign and nontoxic, optical probes, potent photocatalysts, photodynamic agents for therapy and other purposes, antibacterial and antiviral agents, and materials and components in various renewable energy and energy conversion devices. The focus of this project is on the technology for imaging and sensing to take advantage of the most important and uniquely advantageous characteristics and properties of carbon dots, specifically on several high-value uses for immediate commercial development.

    Nontechnical Abstract
    Our goal is to train a cohort of early-stage chemistry and chemical engineering graduate students to the connecting M3 cycle consisting of synthesis (Make), innovative measurements (Measure) and system modeling and sustainable operation (Model), in the context of applied chemistry in Germany. This M3 cycle is critically important in modern chemistry as it represents the most effective way to achieve rapid advances in chemical synthesis and the understanding of chemical transformations, yet this cycle is not broadly implemented in the U.S. chemical science curriculum. The proposed educational excursion will train students to better understand the interrelationship between academia and industry, as well as intercultural differences that they will encounter in a global economy. We aim to use this educational approach as an attractor to recruit highly motivated doctoral students who wish to specialize in innovative measurements, while helping them connect to the broader concept of the M3 cycle, and so contribute to society as interdisciplinary and intercultural ambassadors. There is an intertwined need in chemistry education: (i) to train the next generation experts in advanced and new chemical measurement technology, and (ii) to teach them how to conduct, view and present their specialized and novel measurement methods in the context of problems of utmost interest to chemistry, at the nexus of science discovery and societal needs. Graduate students who have carried out their studies at the M3 interface will undoubtedly think differently as leaders in their field and have a better understanding to connect to the German chemistry landscape. The successes of the M3 educational experience is expected to help inform the development of new courses and emphases for chemistry graduate programs.

    Technical Abstract
    Expert groups in advanced magnetic resonance at University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB) (Han), University of California-Berkeley (UCB)(Reimer), University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA)(Bouchard) and the Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule (RWTH)in Aachen, Germany (Blümich) joined together to pool their advanced analytical tools to work on integrated problem-solving in a three-way M3 cycle, in synergistic collaboration with chemistry and engineering colleagues to concentrate their efforts on the training of a cohort of graduate students. Several research groups at the RWTH Aachen University are ideal partners to pursue this educational endeavor, not only because the RWTH is ranked #1 in forging chemistry-engineering partnerships, but also because there are strong existing multi-PI collaborations between the UCLA/UCSB/UCB and RWTH PIs that the IRES fellows can immerse themselves in. A cohort of 5-7 graduate students per year will be selected and recruited in the first year of their doctoral studies, with the goal to integrate their research and training in the M3 cycle throughout their entire graduate career with leveraging support and collaborative backing. These select students will be prepared pre-departure with weekly online sessions on the German language and culture. The IRES cohort will gather at UCSB for an orientation conference ahead of their departure and travel to Aachen in the summer following the first year of their doctoral studies. The expected outcome is that the graduate students have gained hands-on experience on how to accelerate the discovery and triaging of chemical, materials and system parameters and how to design reaction pathways given a set of starting chemicals. This learning process and evolution will be shared at an annual workshop involving current and past IRES fellows. The effectiveness of the IRES fellows program will be evaluated, and their professional connection within the cohort and the collaborators maintained through social media.

    This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program, organized by Professors Ali Mehrizi-Sani and Chen-Ching Liu from Washington State University (WSU), in collaboration with Prof. Stephen McArthur and his colleagues from the University of Strathclyde (Scotland), provides six US students with the opportunity to participate in the diverse smart grid research atmosphere at one of leading, most highly funded, and most entrepreneurial European universities. This program is developed out of a 20-year collaborative relationship between WSU and the University of Strathclyde. The students will undertake projects to address challenges in renewable energy integration. Ultimately, the research performed in this program will help increase the utilization of distributed renewable energy resources in the power system of the future, the smart grid. This research benefits our society and environment by (i) increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, (ii) increasing career interest in power system and the smart grid, and (iii) improving the quality and quantity of the power engineering workforce in the United States. These benefits directly translate into a more capable and larger student intake that can address the workforce shortage problem; it also helps the transition to a modern power grid with higher efficiency, reliability, and resiliency.

    The students in this program will perform research relevant to smart grid and the electric power system. Electrical power is critical to the U.S. economy. However, most of the current U.S. electric infrastructure is outdated. What exacerbates this problem is that this infrastructure still runs mainly on legacy control, monitoring, and protection systems that may not realize its full potential. While environmental concerns and energy independence recommend utilizing renewable resources in the power system, one of the U.S. grand energy challenges remains to integrate large amounts of renewable energy. These challenges also add to the difficulty of enforcing resiliency of the power system to major disturbances and events. The research to be undertaken in this project seeks to address this challenge through activities on (i) accurate and fast controllers for integration of renewables, (ii) resilient distribution systems, and (iii) and system-agnostic controls of microgrid resources. Compared to the United States, many European countries have a more mature experience in the utilization of renewable energy resources. The University of Strathclyde maintains one of the largest power programs in Europe and, as a prime example of an institution with proven track record in research and industry collaboration, is an ideal partner in this project that combines an international research experience for students with outstanding research capacity.

    just to name a few. The global market for nanofibers is expected to reach ~$2
    billion by 2021, but its growth potential is hindered by limited ability of sizeable
    production of nanofibrous materials with predictable complex, macroscopic architectures,
    and desirable properties.\nUndergraduate and graduate trainees with diverse backgrounds
    from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of South Alabama, Troy
    University, and University of Montevallo will tackle the challenges in the nanofiber
    science and technology through intense real-life research on fabrication of nanofibers
    by an uncommon, high-yield alternating-current electrospinning (ACES) process.
    ACES unveils several new physical phenomena and features that significantly reduce
    or eliminate many disadvantages of traditional techniques while greatly increasing
    the productivity and simplifying material handling. All IRES trainees will gain
    critical international research, industry, and cultural sensitivity experiences
    expanding beyond each participant?s institution through the collaborative work
    at a number of high-profile labs and related industries in three European countries,
    joint presentations/publications, social activities, and interactions with diverse
    international student population at TUL, UT-Lodz and Aalto. The goals of this
    project are to accelerate innovation and increase outcomes in the nanofiber materials
    domain and to develop future leaders and experts capable of operating at a high
    level of advanced research and competence in global collaboration.\n\nPart 2\nThis
    project brings the ongoing collaborations to a higher level and establishes new
    collaborations in the emerging area of fabrication and application of nanofiber
    materials and structures with Technical University of Liberec (TUL, Czech Republic,
    a leading academic center in nanofiber research), Lodz U of Technology (UT-Lodz,
    Poland, a regional leader in heterogeneous catalysis), and  Aalto University (Finland,
    the #1 Finnish University with strong idea-to-industry programs in nanoscience
    and engineering). At least 27 students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham
    (UAB), University of South Alabama, Troy University, and University of Montevallo
    will engage in the hands-on pre-trip training at UAB and a 8 week-long cutting-edge
    research at the forefront of nanofibers science and technology at those premier
    European institutions, followed by the long-term post trip research and outcomes
    dissemination activities. \nIRES trainees will fabricate nanofibers using a high-yield
    Alternating Current Electrospinning (ACES) process, which unveils several physical
    phenomena that significantly reduce or eliminate major disadvantages of traditional
    DC-techniques, while greatly increasing the productivity. Trainees will apply
    the fabricated materials to biomedical scaffolds and smart fabrics at TUL, heterogeneous
    catalysts at UT-Lodz, and novel electrochemical sensors at Aalto. Students will
    have broad options to immerse in quickly evolving research ecosystem at foreign
    sites that stimulates breakthroughs and discoveries, as well as multiple opportunities
    to develop passion for exploration and innovation, and courage to influence and
    excel. Through the team and individual research projects, professional and soft
    skills-building exercises, this IRES will: (i) advance the theory and practice
    of ACES, (ii) help to design a better equipment for sizeable production of nanofiber
    materials and structures, (iii) develop new nanofiber-based materials and structures
    with desired properties and performance in controlled and predictable manner,
    and (iv) foster the training of  globally-engaged experts, visionaries, leaders,
    and team builders for the fast-growing nanofibers research and manufacturing domain,
    and for the relevant fields.\nIRES trainees will regularly reach out to the public,
    other college and school kids, e.g., through a new annual IRES student-led Nanomaterials
    Workshop at TUL, research immersion high school workshop at UAB, and broadcasts
    by JagTV, USA's student-run TV station. All participants will mutually benefit
    through a growing network of advanced research and training facilities. This project
    will enable, in a long-term perspective, a broader synergistic coupling between
    domestic and international research groups by bringing new collaborators and catalyzing
    the continuation of international student exchanges.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "This project will send 3 cohorts of 5 students per year for 10 weeks
    each to conduct research at the University of Bamberg, Germany.  The University
    of Bamberg operates a Smart City Living Laboratory throughout the university and
    the city of Bamberg, Germany that is able to collect information such as noise
    levels, CO2 levels, and the number of people in a particular area from sensors
    throughout the city.  Smart cities collect information and process it to help
    decision makers make better decisions with a fuller understanding of the complex
    interactions of people and services in a city.  Some of the information comes
    from sources that are considered trustworthy such as CCTV cameras deployed by
    city workers; however, these trustworthy sources are often expensive to set up
    and maintain.  Crowd sourcing the information provides a cheaper and often more
    efficient way of obtaining information; however, since people can lie or malicious
    software could lie on their behalf, this information is significantly less trustworthy.
    \ \nOur research examines the interactions between all of the entities in such
    a smart city environment and develops methods for utilizing crowd sourced information
    while protecting the city from malicious users and protects users from people
    who might spy on them through their data.  Researchers will be implementing and
    testing their work in the Living Lab Bamberg in Germany to validate the effectiveness
    of our security systems.  It is expected that this work will result in safer,
    more intelligent smart cities with the potential to improve energy efficiency,
    communication, transportation, and public health.\n\nThis project will address
    several scientific challenges in the security and privacy of smart cities. The
    site at the University of Bamberg was chosen due to the smart city living laboratory
    that the university operates on both the campus and city.  The researchers will
    address the following three scientific challenges:  \ni) Utilization of data from
    untrusted sources is critical because many of the data sources in a smart city
    are the smart phones of users who can intentionally manipulate data or who might
    have malware on their phone that is strategically manipulating data.  Students
    will build defense mechanisms using a combination of game theory and machine learning.
    \nii) Privacy of users is critical to the adoption of crowd sensing for use in
    a smart city and to prevent the abuse of the system by users and administrators
    alike.  Students will build privacy-enhancing technologies that use realistically
    generated cover traffic to obfuscate user data and cyber-physical correlation
    to enable privacy-preserving audits of the data collected by the city. \niii)
    \  Secure incentives help to protect the deployers of tasks from malicious users
    that are seeking to optimize their gain without contributing to the system.  To
    ensure that malicious users do not exploit the incentive system, students will
    create spatio-temporal models of context information that detect if a user was
    actually at the location at the time they reported they were when contributing
    information.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed
    worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit
    and broader impacts review criteria."

    of Materials Research (DMR) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences
    (MPS) and the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE),
    this project aims to advance the use of modern data science in chemistry. In particular,
    the project will advance the field of data-driven chemical research by promoting
    the use of machine learning and other data mining techniques in the molecular
    sciences and by fostering and coalescing a community of stakeholders. The work
    of the project and the community it represents aims to transform chemistry's ability
    to tackle challenging discovery and design problems. This approach can dramatically
    accelerate and streamline the process that leads to chemical innovation -- an
    important factor in economic and technological advancement -- and thus result
    in an improved return on public and private investments. The project also addresses
    corresponding questions of training and workforce development needed in chemistry,
    thus insuring the US's international competitiveness. \n\nThe mission of this
    project is to assert the role of big data research in the chemical domain, i.e.,
    to promote, enable, and advance the ideas of data-driven discovery and rational
    design. The project aims to create a community-driven roadmap as well as facilitate
    concrete solutions that are beyond the scope of the disjointed efforts of its
    individual stakeholders. The Big Data Hubs and Spokes ecosystem is the ideal framework
    to realizing this vision and accelerating progress in this high-priority area
    of research. The effort at hand sets out to implement some of the key findings
    of the recent NSF Division of Chemistry workshop on Framing the Role of Big Data
    and Modern Data Science in Chemistry. The four signature initiatives of this Spoke
    project include (i) the planning, coordination, integration, and consolidation
    of community-developed software tools for big data research in chemistry as well
    as the formulation of guidelines, best practices, and standards; (ii) the organization
    of workshops for community building, to connect solution seekers with solution
    providers, and to address questions ranging from strategic to technical; and (iii)
    the creation and dissemination of community-developed teaching materials as well
    as the formulation of course, program, and curricular recommendations for education
    and workforce development that reflect the changing, data-centric approach in
    chemical research; (iv) providing access to a shared hardware infrastructure for
    community data sets, on-site data mining capacity, and the exploration of domain
    specific method and hardware issues.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

- abstractText: "Drylands (arid and semi-arid ecosystems) are of global ecological
    and socioeconomic importance as they cover nearly half of the earth's terrestrial
    surface and support a large and growing portion of the earth's human population
    and livestock production. Despite their importance, ecological processes in drylands
    are poorly understood relative to wetter systems. This lack of knowledge limits
    available information for informed dryland management. The project aims to address
    this knowledge gap by training US undergraduate and graduate students to carry
    out international research in dryland ecosystems. The Global Drylands Center-Gobabeb
    Research Opportunity will provide intensive training for eighteen US students
    over a three year period. The student activities will last for eight weeks each
    summer, during which students will conduct research at the Gobabeb Research and
    Training Centre, located in the heart of the oldest desert in the world, the Namib
    Desert of Namibia. US students will work collaboratively with Namibian interns,
    Namibian mentors, and US PIs to design and carry out novel research projects that
    will use a unique precipitation gradient to explore how climate and soil composition
    affect ecological processes in drylands. Students will prepare for the research
    experience through an online seminar in the semester before travel and will participate
    in follow-up synthesis activities in the semester following their research experience.
    These research projects will train a cohort of US students in research techniques,
    positioning them for careers that will advance our understanding of dryland ecosystems.
    The use of research teams composed of US students, Namibian interns, and Namibian
    faculty mentors will provide valuable training in collaborative research and communication
    skills. This program will help develop a new generation of internationally-engaged
    dryland scientists, thus enhancing capacities and contributing to the ecological
    knowledge base, paramount for sustainable use and management of drylands. \n\nScientific
    understanding of ecological processes in dryland systems is limited relative to
    wetter systems. This knowledge gap reflects both historical research biases and
    the transmission of these biases to successive generations of student scientists.
    Little scientific study of drylands is amplified by the fact that vast areas of
    global drylands are located in developing nations with limited scientific resources.
    A step toward enhancing our basic and applied knowledge in drylands is providing
    training opportunities for students in international dryland research and developing
    a next generation of scientific leaders who can effectively collaborate in international
    arenas. Increased leadership by US scientists in international dryland research
    will enhance understanding of our own drylands and improve basic science and land
    management in developing nations. The Namib Desert of Namibia offers a unique
    natural experiment for quantifying mechanistic controls over biogeochemical, ecological,
    and physiological processes in drylands because of a steep precipitation gradient
    coincides with contrasting soil surfaces. The close geographic proximity of sites
    with contrasting rainfall and soil types, access to a well-equipped research station,
    and existing relationships with Namibian scientists make this an excellent site
    for a research training program that will help develop a new generation of internationally-engaged
    dryland scientists. The Global Drylands Center-Gobabeb Research Opportunity (GDC-GRO)
    will facilitate research projects which will be carried out by teams of US students
    (undergraduate and graduate) and Namibian interns who will work closely with Namibian
    mentors and US PIs. A total of eighteen US students will participate (four undergraduates
    and two graduate students in each of the three years). Intensive IRES activities
    will last eight weeks each year, with preparation activities in the semester beforehand
    through an online seminar and follow-up synthesis activities in the semester following
    the IRES experience. Key players in this proposal are Namibian mentors (from University
    of Namibia, Namibia University of Science and Technology and Gobabeb Research
    and Training Centre) who are eager to work with student teams and US PIs to develop
    substantive research projects across the Namib precipitation gradient.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    changes in their industries: water and electricity utilities need to generate
    revenue while also encouraging conservation; wastewater facilities are transitioning
    from treatment and disposal to recovery of energy and nutrients. This presents
    an exciting opportunity to reimagine the future of these utilities. The forefront
    of innovation is occurring in low-income but rapidly developing cities like Nairobi,
    Kenya, which are open to new ideas given their more limited previous investments
    in centralized infrastructure. \n\nThe IRES project will engage seventeen students
    over the course of three years to spend 10-12 weeks working alongside collaborators
    in Nairobi, Kenya, including researchers from the University of Nairobi and Strathmore
    University. The research focuses on addressing the common challenges faced by
    water, electricity, and sanitation utilities in rapidly changing cities. Example
    projects include: designing a sensing system for electric vehicles to provide
    grid balancing in Kenya; comparing the environmental and human health impacts
    of neighborhood- and city-wide human waste management options; improving water
    supply operations and planning; and quantifying the flexibility of industrial
    electricity consumption in Kenya. Students will be recruited from multiple disciplines,
    with a focus on ensuring participation by students traditionally underrepresented
    in STEM. To prepare for the summer spent in Kenya, students will enroll in a one-credit
    course. Projects will be designed such that students have clear objectives and
    can accomplish data collection and analysis within the given timespan, and integrate
    their project into their overall student experience. Students will also have the
    opportunity for professional development, including engaging with industries and
    government in Kenya and participating in a one-week workshop on writing and data
    presentation. The result will be a cohort of US students equipped with the ideas,
    skills, and motivation to improve the service delivery of the water, sanitation,
    and electricity utilities of the future and function as members of global workforces.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."

  title: 'IRES Track 1: Envisioning the Water, Electricity, and Sanitation Utilities
    of the Future through a US-Kenya Collaboration'
- abstractText: "With this award, NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering
    provides three years of support for twelve Davidson College undergraduate students
    to engage in high-impact research opportunities in Dusseldorf, Germany in collaboration
    with the research group of Prof. Dr. Laura Hartmann at the Heinrich-Heine-Universitat
    (HHU). The specific research focuses on the preparation of a series of specialized
    compounds that present carbohydrates in a precise fashion to study fundamental
    carbohydrate-protein interactions. These interactions are important because they
    play critical roles in a number of biological processes from cell communication
    to microbial infectivity and cancer. Despite their importance, many questions
    remain as to how the precise presentation of carbohydrates impacts their ability
    to be recognized by proteins, and how the resulting carbohydrate-protein interaction
    impacts downstream biological events. The research outlined in this award aims
    to address this knowledge gap while simultaneously providing valuable research
    opportunities in a high-impact international research setting. Undergraduate participants
    will receive training in carbohydrate chemistry, polymer chemistry, molecular
    spectroscopy, and biochemical and biophysical techniques that will enhance their
    education and prepare them for a competitive international workforce. Furthermore,
    results from this award will promote the progress of science by directly advancing
    the fields of carbohydrate and polymer science, including initiatives highlighted
    under the National Academy of Sciences report, \"Transforming the Glycosciences:
    A Roadmap to the Future (2012)\", which specifically emphasizes a broader understanding
    of the roles of carbohydrate polymers in chemical, biological and industrial processes.
    Long term, the results from this research may ultimately lead to advancements
    in national health, prosperity and welfare by providing a better understanding
    of the fundamental roles carbohydrates play in human health and disease. \n\nOne
    of the major challenges in studying molecular interactions between carbohydrates
    and other biomolecules is the low binding affinity of individual carbohydrate
    subunits. Biological systems overcome this issue by increasing localized concentrations
    of carbohydrate residues or by the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands
    on proteins, lipids or cell surfaces. Molecular scaffolds, which can be selectively
    tuned to vary the number and density of sugar ligands along a defined oligomeric
    backbone, can be used to gain fundamental insights into multivalent carbohydrate
    interactions and the processes they govern. The research in this proposal, which
    will be conducted with Davidson College undergraduate participants and in collaboration
    with Prof. Dr. Laura Hartmann and her team at Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, uses
    a systematic approach to synthesize several precision glycoconjugates to study
    the relationships between the ways in which carbohydrate ligands are presented
    (e.g. on a rigid oligoproline scaffold versus a more flexible oligo(amidoamine)
    scaffold), and how that presentation impacts carbohydrate binding in two classes
    of carbohydrate binding proteins: galectins and the C-type lectins. The overarching
    research question that will be addressed by the proposed research is: How does
    the presentation of carbohydrates on well-defined rigid or flexible scaffolds
    impact their ability to engage proteins involved in specific recognition events?
    The outcomes of this research will provide greater insight into factors that govern
    carbohydrate recognition and may help scientists better understand how recognition
    events and the corresponding biological outcomes of those events are tuned by
    carbohydrate display.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been
    deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "Approximately 95% of all land, sea and air vehicles in the world
    today rely on petroleum to move passengers and freight both locally and internationally.
    This transportation fuel mix produces ~25% of all greenhouse gas emissions and
    is projected to grow in the future with modernization of developing countries.
    International energy agencies note that if transport is to contribute to CO2 reductions
    to meet the 2 degree C global average temperature target, use of technologies
    such as hybrid electric and all electric transportation will have to increase
    in the future. Thus, advances in transportation technologies are clearly a national
    and international issue, and require globally-minded engineers and scientists
    to advance interdisciplinary technologies to develop cleaner regional and global
    transportation systems. Virginia Tech (VT) proposes to expand upon the Future
    Electric Transportation Systems ( FETS) IRES partnership with the University of
    Nottingham (UoN), with a broadened scope and stronger engagement with industry
    and the UK government to establish the Energy, Environment, and Future Electric
    Transportation Systems (E-FETS) IRES program. E-FETS cohorts of ~9 per year will
    investigate next generation electrical power systems for environmentally-friendly
    fuels and extraction methods; energy-efficient, hybridized power train vehicles
    and systems; light-weighting of vehicle structures; and the human factors issues
    that accompany their use and adoption. Among the broader impacts of this IRES
    program are the promotion of international research collaborations that foster
    innovative technical leaders capable of creating and effectively integrating electric
    transportation systems into our society as a means to address efficient energy
    use.  \n\nE-FETS will provide an intensive ten-week research experience to undergraduates
    and graduate students with five of the University of Nottingham's internationally
    recognized research groups. These include power electronics, human factors, geo-energy,
    composites and manufacturing, and aerospace propulsion and advanced diagnostics.
    The program will consist of two phases. The first phase includes three pre-departure
    workshops plus three weeks of mentorship and research preparation at VT to orient
    students to the experience and the project scope. This pre-departure preparation
    aims to build the E-FETS student cohort team in preparation for their work individually
    and together. The second phase consists of 7 weeks at the UoN engaged in concentrated
    research with UoN faculty mentors and facilities. In addition to supervision from
    a VT and UoN faculty member, students will work collaboratively as part of a large
    research team including faculty, Ph.D. students and postdoctoral research fellows.
    To facilitate additional professional development, students will also be matched
    with an industry mentor who will meet with the student before, during and after
    their research experience. These mentors will enhance the students? experience
    with international career exploration, professional development, and networking
    in their field and industry. Seminars focused on the scope of E-FETS research
    goals are planned during each phase of the program, providing students with the
    opportunity to connect their individual research projects with the unified research
    theme of E-FETS, and present and get feedback on their IRES experience. By engaging
    industry partners with IRES projects, the E-FETS IRES seeks to leverage industry
    and UK government to grow the IRES program and develop a basis for sustainability
    beyond the grant.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    Raman microscopy is a powerful tool for nondestructive, label-free chemical imaging that has found numerous applications in the pharmaceutical, forensic, semiconductor, materials science, and biological fields.  The PI has developed a faster and lower cost Raman micro-spectrometer, a tool that allows mapping of chemical composition and other material properties at microscopic scales.  Broader and easier access to Raman mapping could in turn prompt innovation in how the tool is used for a vast range of applications, from biomedical research, to food and pharma, to engineering materials.  This project provides an opportunity for market research that will result in a thorough and deep understanding of the customer needs when it comes to chemical mapping and how their technology could potentially alleviate the customer's pain points and capture new customers.  The scientist involved will learn fundamental entrepreneurial skills that will not only help in the commercialization efforts of this technology but could also be applied towards their future research endeavors.

    The PI's technology is a novel confocal Raman microscope capable of imaging at speeds up to 100 times faster than conventional point-scan Raman microscopy. This project involves market research where a range of potential customers are involved in assessing the current chemical imaging market and the requirements for future products in this field.  The result will help guide a decision on whether this product (or a similar product) has market value, the most valuable product features that can be incorporated or developed, and the market(s) where these products should initially be marketed.  With this investigation, it is expected that a proper decision on the future of this technology can be made along with a decision on future developments that increase the likelihood of commercial success.

    This innovation demonstrates how advanced algorithm information technologies can transform the medical care delivery system by shifting the focus to early diagnosis. This technology identifies suspicious skin lesions as positive or negative for the structural properties of Buruli ulcers. Furthermore, this technique validates the classification system for other skin lesions which can be improved and expanded to include other types of skin diseases for humans, animals, and also plants. Point-of-care diagnostics for skin diseases have the potential to not only identify diseases in the early stages, but also create opportunities to initiate medical interventions in earlier stages of a disease, thereby reducing medical costs by treating diseases with antibiotic therapy instead of surgical interventions and eliminating any unnecessary pain and suffering resulting from complications of late-stage disease diagnosis. This innovation is critical for differential diagnosis, disease surveillance, collecting environmental contextual data, medication adherence, and advancing health literacy. This work is important because it contributes to a wider body of knowledge that seeks to validate algorithm development for point-of-care diagnostics, and ultimately improves access to healthcare for rural and hard-to-reach populations, also reducing barriers to care for otherwise stigmatizing and debilitating diseases.

    Advancements in point-of-care diagnostics for neglected tropical diseases, and neglected infections of poverty represents an opportunity to decrease both the incidence and prevalence of debilitating and disfiguring diseases. These otherwise preventable diseases represent the most disability-adjusted life years lost. Representative of an interdisciplinary intervention, image diagnostics for skin diseases require the development of effective means for intervention design, management, and evaluation while enhancing the relationships and collaborations working internationally, across cultures, with community-based primary care, and to also include opportunities for incorporating telehealth to address access to care in resource-limited and hard-to-reach communities. Opportunities to more widely disseminate this research, and to include commercial potential expands the scope of this innovation and provides additional education and training opportunities for students of engineering and public health, but also for clinicians, and community-based healthcare providers. Successful implementation of point-of-care diagnostics for early stage disease detection advances the disciplines and allows for the translation of the innovation, analysis, synthesis, and interpretation of research for future education and training. Lastly, the advancement of this type of innovation has the ability to shift the medical system to early diagnosis reducing the overall disease burden of ill-health and disability due to late stage diagnosis of disease.

- abstractText: "The Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) is a cooperative initiative
    involving 10 federal agencies and 154 recipient institutions managing federally
    sponsored research funds.  The goal of the FDP is to increase research productivity
    by streamlining the administrative process for research while maintaining effective
    stewardship of and full accountability for federal funds. More specifically, FDP
    strives to maximize research performance per federal dollar by minimizing the
    monetary and time burdens associated with the administrative aspects of federally-sponsored
    research. Since its inception, the FDP has successfully worked to reduce administrative
    burden while accommodating continuous changes to the policies and regulations
    most significant to research administration. \n\nThrough the unique forum provided
    by the FDP, federal agency officials work collaboratively with administrative,
    faculty, and technical representatives from a broad range of academic research
    institutions to identify and assess unnecessary burden resulting from policies
    and processes that can be addressed only through cooperation. Targeted projects,
    pilots, and demonstrations are an important and defining component of the FDP.
    Once a new approach is successfully beta tested by a few willing institutions
    and agencies within the FDP, it is generally accepted by the FDP's members and
    often by most research funding agencies and recipients. A study and 2016 report
    by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on \"Optimizing
    the Nation's Investment in Academic Research\" cites and references the work of
    the FDP throughout.   The work that the FDP has accomplished in the past has achieved
    national recognition and the current proposal outlines further plans for maximizing
    federal investments in research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    This project will enable the reproducible analysis and sharing of large human brain imaging datasets.  Imaging the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential tool for the study of the human brain, but the processing of large neuroimaging datasets is often a difficult and time-consuming process. This project will improve the ability of researchers to analyze these data more effectively and share the results.  This work will build upon the OpenNeuro project, which provides researchers with the ability to easily upload and share neuroimaging data. The first aim of this project is to develop the ability to process these datasets using national supercomputing resources. Because these resources are both much more powerful and more cost-effective than commercial cloud computing resources, this extension will allow researchers to process larger datasets using more sophisticated analysis procedures.  The second aim is to extend the reach of data storage and processing beyond standard neuroimaging datasets to include heterogeneous datasets with clinical and psychological data in addition to brain imaging data. A large study of human brain development will be used as a test case for this extension. The third aim of this project is to engage researchers and software developers in order to develop a broad community that will further extend the reach and capabilities of the proposed technical developments and promote the sustainability of the resources beyond the grant period.

    The first aim will implement the ability to execute computational workflows using national supercomputing resources through a Science-As-A-Service model, via technologies such as the Agave API and the Singularity container system.  This will provide the ability for researchers to execute complex containerized workflows using large datasets, providing a long-term sustainable computational platform for analysis of open data. The second aim will involve the extension of the current OpenNeuro platform to represent data from a large longitudinal neurodevelopmental study, in order to allow the joint analysis of imaging, clinical, psychological, and genetic data.  The third aim will engage the relevant user and developer communities through workshops and code sprints.

This challenge is a socio-technical, collective action problem that can be addressed through a combination of tools and incentives. The project proposes to holding a series of workshops along with proofs-of-concept implementations. These workshops will result in approaches to decentralize the sharing of data in the long tail, through socio-technical approaches that appropriately incentivize and facilitate data integration by smaller labs. Such an interdisciplinary community will provide crucial real-world input to computer science researchers, which will give their research into tools the potential for larger impact in ecological practice and will yield better tools for ecologists.

    Today's cities and communities, and their residents, are increasingly connected, and decisions are informed by actionable, real-time data. Data is making modern cities and local communities faster and safer, as well as more sustainable, livable, and equitable. At the same time, smart city technologies raise concerns about individuals' privacy, autonomy, choice, and possible misuse. Government officials are raising important questions about who should own data, how privacy protections for public-facing technologies work, who and how to communicate with the public about privacy, and more. The long-term vision of the project is to help municipal leaders strengthen their ability to collect, use, and share data in a responsible manner. This will help grow privacy-preserving innovations across applications and geographic boundaries for the public good. In this way, the Smart Privacy for Smart Cities Spoke will serve to increase public knowledge, understanding and engagement with privacy-related concerns, and ultimately promote the public's trust in smart city technologies and in their local government.

    The Smart Privacy for Smart Cities Spoke is a collaborative project led by the FPF Education and Innovation Foundation (FPF EIF). It will undertake three interrelated activities to help city/community innovators understand and incorporate privacy considerations and protections into smart city projects. First, the Spoke will produce a privacy risk assessment framework for smart city projects, including guidance on what policies, practices and accountability structures should be put in place and how to weigh benefits of new or expanded data techniques against attendant privacy and security risks. The framework will feature a de-identification component as de-identification is one of the primary measures that organizations can take to protect and share data in a privacy-preserving manner. Second, the Spoke will establish a network of privacy leaders for smart cities and communities, helping municipal officials better understand, communicate, and collaboratively address privacy issues and principles. Lastly, the Spoke will hold two workshops in partnership with MetroLab Network, a national network of 40+ city-university partnerships advancing technological approaches to urban challenges. The workshops will serve to launch the privacy leaders network; educate network members about the privacy risk assessment framework; and identify areas for further collaboration and research, particularly in applying the framework to specific technologies and data uses. Expected project outcomes include wide dissemination of the privacy risk assessment framework and its adoption in specific localities; development of new collaborations and partnerships through the privacy leaders network and associated workshops; and as an overall outcome, the advancement of civic leaders' knowledge, understanding, and application of privacy protection(s) toward standards of practice for smart cities and privacy. The project will support and leverage the Hub Network, in particular the South Big Data Hub, NSF's Smart and Connected Communities program, and the MetroLab Network of city-university partners.

    The opioid crisis ravaging Ohio and the Midwest disproportionally affects small and rural communities. Harnessing and deploying data holds promise for developing a response to this crisis by policymakers, healthcare providers, and citizens of the communities. Currently, there are many barriers to getting data into the hands of individuals on the frontlines. Crucial data are siloed across law enforcement, public health departments, hospitals and clinics, and county administrations; data often are inaccurate or collected in non-standard ways across different agencies and departments; the stigma of drug abuse limits accurate reporting of drug-related deaths; and information is not shared with the community and other stakeholders because of the lack of a privacy and security framework. Such barriers, for example, prevent individuals with addictions or their families and friends from locating available treatment centers or obtaining other important information in a timely way. Similarly, it is difficult for first responders and healthcare providers to obtain critical up-to-date information. In predominantly rural counties, these challenges are especially daunting because there is often poor connectivity and communication infrastructure. This Big Data Spoke project involves developing scalable, flexible, and connectivity-rich data-driven approaches to address the opioid epidemic. The cyberinfrastructure framework, OpenOD, will be initially designed and deployed in small and rural communities in Appalachia Ohio and the Midwest, where the need for data and connection are greatest. Based upon significant community input, OpenOD will also create end-user applications or enterprise solutions to support stakeholders and communities to mount a response they feel will be most efficient and beneficial at the local level. As a Spoke to NSF?s Midwest Big Data Hub, our efforts can be efficiently scaled, disseminated, and applied to the opioid and other societal problems such as infant mortality, crime, and natural disasters. This project fits within NSF's mission to promote the progress of science (contribute to the science and engineering of large socially relevant cyberinfrastructures) to advance the health and welfare of US citizens (by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address societal problems; establishing sustainable partnerships between academia, industry, government and communities; increasing data literacy and community engagement with data science; and enhancing research and education via development/adaptation of training modules and courses in data analytics).

    The main goal of this project is to help small and rural communities in the Midwest address the opioid epidemic via BIGDATA (BD) technology. While no communities have been spared, small and rural communities face unique challenges in confronting the opioid epidemic: knowledge and data exist in siloes across multiple organizations with varying jurisdictional boundaries; efforts to collect, link, and analyze data are hampered by a lack of infrastructure and tools; rural areas are plagued by "dead zones" in cellular connectivity; communities lack capacity for data collection, and analytics; needs and resources across effected communities are not uniform and require BD approaches that are flexible, open, leverage significant community input, and can be dutifully validated. Our proposed solution is OpenOD, a framework that provides uniform, relevant and timely access to data. Working integrally with the Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) and our partners, our three main objectives are to: (1) Work with local communities to understand strengths and gaps in cyberinfrastructure, data availability, and need for data analytics workforce skills. (2) Assemble flexible cyberinfrastructure that includes a data commons, stakeholder-usable and cloud-amenable data analytics and visualization tools, and internet connectivity with both mobile and non-mobile capabilities. (3) Validate, evaluate, and disseminate cyberinfrastructure and data analytics tools to stakeholder groups throughout the region while fostering new partnerships. OpenOD will create approaches that will allow governing units to deploy openly available tools rather than rely on proprietary tools. In this way, existing disparities in data access and ensuing responses are effectively addressed. The potential contributions of the project are to: (1) Increase BD and STEM literacy and community engagement in underrepresented groups given the operating milieu of OpenOD in rural areas where the population is indigent and lacks adequate skills to join the modern workforce. (2) Improve well-being of individuals in society by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address the opioid crisis; improved connectivity and timely delivery of critical information will accelerate community responsiveness and improve preventive strategies. (3) Provide infrastructure for research and education will be improved given that project activities will deliver linked, curated data sets to community stakeholders, researchers and educators. Training modules and courses adapted and developed and shared with local/regional educators and will remain with the communities after the funding period has ended. In addition, new and established partnerships will allow sustainability of the project in the communities for the long-term.

  title: 'Spokes: MEDIUM: MIDWEST: Collaborative: Community-Driven Data Engineering
    for Substance Abuse Prevention in the Rural Midwest'
- abstractText: |-
    The opioid crisis ravaging Ohio and the Midwest disproportionally affects small and rural communities. Harnessing and deploying data holds promise for developing a response to this crisis by policymakers, healthcare providers, and citizens of the communities. Currently, there are many barriers to getting data into the hands of individuals on the frontlines. Crucial data are siloed across law enforcement, public health departments, hospitals and clinics, and county administrations; data often are inaccurate or collected in non-standard ways across different agencies and departments; the stigma of drug abuse limits accurate reporting of drug-related deaths; and information is not shared with the community and other stakeholders because of the lack of a privacy and security framework. Such barriers, for example, prevent individuals with addictions or their families and friends from locating available treatment centers or obtaining other important information in a timely way. Similarly, it is difficult for first responders and healthcare providers to obtain critical up-to-date information. In predominantly rural counties, these challenges are especially daunting because there is often poor connectivity and communication infrastructure. This Big Data Spoke project involves developing scalable, flexible, and connectivity-rich data-driven approaches to address the opioid epidemic. The cyberinfrastructure framework, OpenOD, will be initially designed and deployed in small and rural communities in Appalachia Ohio and the Midwest, where the need for data and connection are greatest. Based upon significant community input, OpenOD will also create end-user applications or enterprise solutions to support stakeholders and communities to mount a response they feel will be most efficient and beneficial at the local level. As a Spoke to NSF?s Midwest Big Data Hub, our efforts can be efficiently scaled, disseminated, and applied to the opioid and other societal problems such as infant mortality, crime, and natural disasters. This project fits within NSF's mission to promote the progress of science (contribute to the science and engineering of large socially relevant cyberinfrastructures) to advance the health and welfare of US citizens (by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address societal problems; establishing sustainable partnerships between academia, industry, government and communities; increasing data literacy and community engagement with data science; and enhancing research and education via development/adaptation of training modules and courses in data analytics).

    The main goal of this project is to help small and rural communities in the Midwest address the opioid epidemic via BIGDATA (BD) technology. While no communities have been spared, small and rural communities face unique challenges in confronting the opioid epidemic: knowledge and data exist in siloes across multiple organizations with varying jurisdictional boundaries; efforts to collect, link, and analyze data are hampered by a lack of infrastructure and tools; rural areas are plagued by "dead zones" in cellular connectivity; communities lack capacity for data collection, and analytics; needs and resources across effected communities are not uniform and require BD approaches that are flexible, open, leverage significant community input, and can be dutifully validated. Our proposed solution is OpenOD, a framework that provides uniform, relevant and timely access to data. Working integrally with the Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) and our partners, our three main objectives are to: (1) Work with local communities to understand strengths and gaps in cyberinfrastructure, data availability, and need for data analytics workforce skills. (2) Assemble flexible cyberinfrastructure that includes a data commons, stakeholder-usable and cloud-amenable data analytics and visualization tools, and internet connectivity with both mobile and non-mobile capabilities.  (3) Validate, evaluate, and disseminate cyberinfrastructure and data analytics tools to stakeholder groups throughout the region while fostering new partnerships. OpenOD will create approaches that will allow governing units to deploy openly available tools rather than rely on proprietary tools. In this way, existing disparities in data access and ensuing responses are effectively addressed. The potential contributions of the project are to: (1) Increase BD and STEM literacy and community engagement in underrepresented groups given the operating milieu of OpenOD in rural areas where the population is indigent and lacks adequate skills to join the modern workforce. (2) Improve well-being of individuals in society by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address the opioid crisis; improved connectivity and timely delivery of critical information will accelerate community responsiveness and improve preventive strategies. (3) Provide infrastructure for research and education will be improved given that project activities will deliver linked, curated data sets to community stakeholders, researchers and educators. Training modules and courses adapted and developed and shared with local/regional educators and will remain with the communities after the funding period has ended. In addition, new and established partnerships will allow sustainability of the project in the communities for the long-term.

    The risk to coastal populations and infrastructure from flooding due to sea level rise, severe storms, and river discharge will increase for U.S. southern states. The vision of this project is that communities occupying low-lying coastal areas of the southern US will be protected and develop in a sustainable manner through planning based on knowledge, conservation, and wise use of sensitive lands. Researchers from the University of South Florida's College of Marine Science and the School of Geosciences, Texas A&M University Corpus Christi, and Google Earth Engine are collaborating with the South Big Data Hub through this project to develop more accurate, ultra-high resolution topographic, land cover, and urban environment geospatial products. The project examines in detail areas that were directly impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017, and identifies flood-prone areas across the region. The 3D maps show habitat diversity, needed to plan for conservation and development in these important ecosystems.

    This project will develop the improved topographic and land cover maps of the south States within 50 Km of the coast from Texas to Florida (an area >220,000 square Km). The maps will be constructed using a Big Data approach, using detailed historical airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data collected from airplanes merged with high spatial resolution (<2 m pixel) multispectral commercial satellite imagery. The project will also include research into detailed 3D mapping of urban areas using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods; specifically the project will map portions of Houston/Corpus Christi in Texas, and Tampa/Saint Petersburg in Florida, using Kite Photography and light aircraft. The production of land cover maps and digital elevation models requires the fusion of very large amounts of disparate data and efficient, automated techniques. The project will develop the strategies to aggregate these data into useful products using Google Earth Engine and a High Performance Computing cluster. The project will distribute all products openly via NOAA's Digital Coastal portal.

- abstractText: "This project focuses on investigating a new paradigm in renewable
    energy harvesting that would be of great use for developing modular power source
    for use in most of the developing world, and specifically for the continent of
    Africa.  Currently only 20-23% of the population in Africa has access to electricity.
    \ Large percentage of the population lives far from urban centers.  Only portable
    energy sources will be able to meet, at least partially, the energy needs of rural
    populations.  A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled
    in this program will engage in research on a novel concept of renewable energy
    harvesting.  They will develop working modules that will be tested in the field
    with the aim of producing efficient portable energy sources to improve the lives
    of people living in rural Africa.  In addition, the cultural experience gained
    through interactions with the tribal communities in Africa, and the knowledge
    gained on the way of life in each tribe, their societal rules and norms, and the
    struggles they face in day-to-day life, will transform their view of the world.
    \ Their efforts will be highly rewarding, as they will be contributing to increase
    the renewable and portable power generation in these remote areas that will greatly
    improve the quality of life for the segment of the world population that is lagging
    behind the norms. \nTo implement the project the PI at the University of South
    Florida (USF) will collaborate with the researchers at the Botswana International
    University of Science and Technology (BIUST).  After completing a 3-week research
    program at USF, students will travel to Botswana and will team up with a cohort
    of students at BIUST for a 5-week period where they will learn, live, work, and
    travel together. \n\nThe primary goal of research is to study the feasibility
    of combining thermoelectric modules and solar devices to generate much higher
    electrical power than what is possible with individual devices.  Thermoelectric
    modules formed with materials of high Seebeck coefficient can produce high voltages
    but low conductivity that leads to low currents.  Typical solar cell open-circuit
    voltages are relatively low, but high absorption of radiation can generate high
    density of carriers.  However, high carrier recombination losses lead to low short
    circuit current.  This project will investigate a novel paradigm in which the
    relatively high voltage (1-4 V) produced by the thermoelectric modules from the
    recovery of waste heat of cooking stoves used in rural Africa will be used to
    reverse-bias the solar cell for generating a high photo-generated current.  The
    combination of the high voltage, high current, combined with a suitable circuit
    design, has the potential to enhance power generation and more efficient charging
    of batteries or capacitors.  The outcome will be educating a cohort of graduate
    and undereducated students on energy challenges of the rural communities in the
    world, and developing innovative concepts based on fundamental science to resolve
    issues of the global society. Though the initial effort is to develop a power
    source for rural Africa, the concept can be extended to multitude of commercial
    products and military applications where power can be generated when plugging
    into the power grid is not an option.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The goal of this Baja Basins International Research Experiences for Students (Baja Basins IRES) project is for undergraduate student participants to develop skills in conducting and communicating scientific research, to utilize an integrative field and lab research approach using digital technology and modern analytical lab equipment, and to learn international cooperation by collaborating side-by-side with Mexican students, professors, and mining professionals to address research questions on the tectonic evolution of  economically important rift margin basins in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Each year of this three-year program, a cohort of ten undergraduate students will be hosted by Minera Boleo mine for four weeks in January in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Students will conduct geologic fieldwork in topical groups (basin analysis, volcanology, neotectonics, and mineralogy) that will be co-mentored by Mexican and U.S. faculty. Field samples will be sent for geochemical, petrographic, and geochronological analyses. Then in July of the same year, Baja Basins IRES students will reconvene for collaborative lab work and data analyses at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. This will culminate in preparation of student abstracts and poster displays for a local symposium.  Clear educational outcomes and career goals will be measured by appropriate assessment strategies. We will recruit junior undergraduate geoscience majors both nationally and regionally near our home institutions, as this will facilitate the participation of under-represented minority, first-time college, and veteran students who often remain close to their hometown when pursuing higher education. Our collaboration with Mexican colleagues and mining professionals, and the international nature of the fieldwork will provide an unparalleled avenue for cultural enrichment for the students as well as an experience in global cooperation that will be invaluable for a student's future success in an increasingly global workforce and economy.

    The Baja Basins International Research Experiences for Students (Baja Basins IRES) project will provide ten undergraduate student a year with the opportunity to investigate basins located along the central Gulf of California rift in Baja California Sur Mexico, an area that has not been thoroughly mapped within the framework of tectonics and thus provides an excellent field location to study the progressive evolution of a rifted continental margin and its unique continued magmatic activity and economic mineralization. The young geologic age of the sedimentary basins, excellent exposures, and field access, as well as sedimentary fill with numerous tuffs and uplifted terraces dateable by radiometric and OSL methods, make it ideal for resolving the rates of development of structures and resulting depositional systems. This Baja Basins IRES program will provide students with an unprecedented opportunity to collaborate internationally with mentors from our partner universities in Mexico (Universidad Autonoma de Baja California Sur and Universidad de Guanajuato) and several mining companies. Students will develop field and laboratory skills in basin analysis and tectonics in a volcanic-sedimentary sequence that is geologically interesting, economically important, and culturally diverse.

    This project will support the "Graduate-level Research in Industrial Projects for Students-Berlin" (GRIPS) led by the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM). The program will offer graduate students in mathematics and related disciplines the opportunity to work on industry-sponsored research problems in Berlin through a collaboration with Research Campus MODAL in Berlin, Germany. MODAL has existing industrial partners affiliated with their laboratories that provide their research groups with interesting and challenging research problems.  The program will be eight weeks in length; eight US graduate students will participate each summer.  Half of the US students each year will be women, and one or more will be a member of an underrepresented ethnic group. MODAL will  recruit 8 European students to form 4 research groups of two US and two European students each, and provide academic mentors. The program will not only produce interesting research in applications of mathematics to real-life problems, but will give a diverse group of US students an insight into industrial research and provide them with hands-on experience of working on industrial problems. One of the goals of the program is to make the students aware of the multiple career pathways open to them and highlight the value and adaptability of their mathematics skills as applied to interesting real-life problems.  The students will also receive invaluable experience collaborating with foreign colleagues and companies. The projects will be the natural outgrowth of MODAL's existing industry research partnerships, and will be selected in collaboration with IPAM.    Participants will produce a final report on their work, and will be encouraged to submit their work for conference presentations and/or publication in technical journals.  It is expected that many of the participants will continue the research and collaborations they started in the program.

    Applied mathematics research has become increasingly important and relevant to engineering problems and, indeed, to everyday life. Increasingly, core applied mathematics topics, ranging from applied probability, to partial differential equation, to optimization, find important applications in areas such as materials science, mathematical biology, operations research, and, more recently, machine learning. Applications of mathematical techniques to real-life problems require both a deep understanding of mathematical theory, as well as acute awareness of both the physical and technical aspects of the problem, as well as implementation details of any numerical algorithms or simulations. For this reason, such successful applications are often a combination of individual and team efforts, with the main problem being divided into more specialized parts, and specific expertise of each team member brought to bear on each such  component.The exact topics of the research projects will change from year to year and will depend on the interest of industry and academic researchers involved.  Generally speaking, the projects will apply mathematical techniques to questions of optimization (such as optimization of rail network throughput), efficient simulation (such as simulation of modern nanophotonic devices) and machine learning (such as analysis of medical mass data sets).

- abstractText: "The islands of Oceania are home to diverse fish communities and a
    vibrant myriad of human cultures, all of which have histories are inseparably
    tied to characteristics of the ocean and the islands themselves (e.g. resource
    availability and habitat space), and extent of connectivity among distant islands
    (e.g. currents, migration, etc.). These unifying concepts between culture and
    marine ecology make the holistic study of Pacific Island life ideal for a cross-disciplinary
    research experience.  The PAC-ISLEs program is a year-long research experience
    punctuated by a six-week trip to Oceania, where students will conduct independent
    research projects in marine biology and anthropology, and connect the shared themes
    uniting the two disciplines.  Each year new cohorts will visit a different island
    in Oceania (American Samoa, Tonga, Pohnpei), where they will immerse themselves
    in local communities and collaborate with key foreign mentors that possess expertise
    in community-based conservation, marine ecology, and public education.  Upon returning
    to the US, students will take advantage of the extensive natural history and ethnology
    collections at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture to support their
    research projects, and help them share their findings with the public, including
    a highly-engaged community of Pacific Islanders in the Seattle metropolitan area
    and beyond.  \n\nThe islands of Oceania support fish communities and human cultures
    whose histories are inseparably tied to their physical and geographic characteristics
    (e.g. resource availability and habitat space), and the extent of connectivity
    among distant islands (e.g. dispersal potential, gene flow, history of human migrations
    and trade). Students in the PAC-ISLEs program will travel to a unique island each
    of three years to explore these ties between culture and marine ecology, and characterize
    historic changes by measuring similarities in cultural objects or traditional
    activities among islands, and (for fishes) population genetics, taxonomic composition,
    and phylogeography. Students working with fish communities will focus mainly on
    the evolution and community structure of cryptobenthic reef fishes, a poorly studied
    group that can serve as an ideal indicator for evolutionary and contemporary change
    across Pacific Islands. Students working on Pacific Island anthropology will focus
    on aspects of culture that are directly linked to the ocean either through their
    material origins, or role in passing on knowledge about the ocean to future generations.
    Much like the biological communities of Pacific Islands, cultural items may be
    compared across different islands to show the history of change, local adaptation,
    and technological progression. When these data are analyzed and contextualized
    with existing and extensive biological and anthropological collections from Oceania
    at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, findings from PAC-ISLEs have
    the potential to greatly advance our understanding of biological and cultural
    diversity on and around Pacific Islands, while promoting an equitable exchange
    of knowledge between scientists and Pacific Islander communities. Student activities

    Economic globalization is transforming the nature of the engineering profession.  The assignment of U.S. engineers overseas has become common business practice, as global enterprises establish corporate as well as research and development centers worldwide. To remain at the forefront of science and technology and to sustain our nation's global leadership in engineering, we must train our engineering graduates to be productive professionals in tomorrow's global business world and provide them the skills they will need to collaborate with international partners. This three-year IRES program will teach some of those critical skills to U.S. engineering students by providing hands-on research training and cultural experiences in one of the fastest growing regions in the world. The students will conduct research in Egypt with U.S. and Egyptian investigators in the increasingly important field of sustainable urban design. The need for sustainable housing and infrastructure is particularly acute in Egypt, a nation where 95% of the population lives on just 6% of the land area. Students will leverage the many national research initiatives currently underway in Egypt to investigate and test sustainable infrastructure designs. Participants will receive extensive mentoring before, during, and after their international experience from the U.S. and Egyptian researchers, with the ultimate goal of conducting high-level research and preparing research papers for publication in peer-reviewed journals. By working closely with their international mentors, the students will enhance their cross-cultural skills, foreign language abilities, and professional experience, preparing them to excel in a multinational environment.

    This three-year IRES project will provide approximately 30 undergraduate and graduate engineering students research training and cultural experiences in Egypt. The students will work with U.S. mentors and Egyptian researchers at one of the leading national research centers in Egypt, the National Housing and Building Research Center. The program will focus on the multidisciplinary theme of Infrastructure Design for Sustainable Urban Communities. The Egyptian government is currently pressing major research initiatives and demonstration projects related to sustainable urban design, including entire new cities built around sustainability principles. Our students will leverage these ongoing programs to explore and evaluate new designs for urban infrastructure that consider building materials, construction methods, energy efficiency, and water conservation. Working with our Egyptian partners, the researchers have identified eight research projects for the first year of the program that address the topics of sustainable affordable housing, the assessment of sustainable building codes, infrastructure health monitoring, sustainable building materials, water and stormwater management, and intelligent building designs. Additional research topics will be developed in subsequent years. Students will work side-by-side with Egyptian researchers with the goal of performing high-level research and producing student-led, peer-reviewed publications. The program will ultimately produce students who have the skills and international perspective necessary to pursue careers in collaborative international research.

    This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will provide  international research experiences for at least 12 undergraduate and/or graduate students to carry out international collaborative researches at the School of Renewable Energy of North China Electric Power University (NCEPU) in Beijing, China for 8 weeks. The objective of the IRES project is to provide the future American engineers a global perspective and opportunities for their professional growth through meaningful international cooperative research training, networking and mentoring in the fields of renewable energy and environmental sustainability in general, and biomass processing technology and wind turbine aeromechanics, in particular. This  project will bring together IRES participants, involved professors, Chinese faculty members, and their graduate/undergraduate students with multi-cultural background in a multi-level learning experience infused with the excitement of discovery. It will train participants conduct research  in an international research environment  to remain at the forefront of world science and technology, making them more proficient in the technical subjects. The program will provide opportunities for their professional development to build their future collaboration network and expose them to Chinese culture and tradition, applicable technological trends and business practices.

    The research themes of this IRES program are wind turbine aeromechanics and pyrolysis-based biomass thermochemical conversion. By leveraging the unique research facilities and instruments/equipment available at NCEPU and under the supervision of the Chinese faulty mentors, the IRES students on "biomass track" will investigate the effects of blended biomass feedstocks and catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes for synergistic production of high quality biofuels and value-added chemicals, while the IRES students on "wind energy track" will conduct comprehensive experimental investigations to quantify surface wind characteristics and evaluate their effects on the aeromechanic performance and wake interferences of wind turbines sited over various complex terrains for higher total power yield and better durability of wind turbines operating on onshore and offshore wind farms. In addition to working in the laboratory to conduct innovative research, the IRES students will also participate in various social and cultural exchanging activities in order to enhance student-faculty, student-mentor and student-student interactions to enable the IRES participants to build their personal friendship and professional connections with participating Chinese mentors and students as well as among the IRES participants themselves on which to build networking for their future professional development and collaboration.

- abstractText: "Fulfilling the promise of \"Big Data\" for fields, such as migration
    studies, climate science, and food security systems, requires accurate and timely
    data from countries across the globe. Data collected through Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) technologies, such as remote sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
    have the potential to contribute to global data hubs. However, most IoT applications
    and their data structures are designed to solve local problems, such as crop protection
    and local food shortage predictions. This IRES SITTE project will train 18 U.S.
    master's students in multicriteria design of and policies for IoT systems with
    the aim of making local IoT data available to global data scientists. \n\nThe
    project involves collaborations with professors/mentors at University of Rwanda
    and Carnegie Mellon Africa, both in Kigali, Rwanda, the former of which serves
    as the Center of Excellence for IoT under the World Bank's Eastern and Southern
    Africa Higher Education Centers of Excellence program. Through the collaboration,
    students will receive interdisciplinary research training in wireless networks,
    software engineering, policy studies and sociotechnical systems. This interdisciplinary
    training will enable designs of low cost IoT systems, usable in a range of contexts,
    including the U.S., while increasing access to data by biology/agriculture and
    forced migration scientists. The training will also enhance students' as well
    as the project's advisory board, consisting of academic scientists and an industry
    innovation professional, on information and communication technology (ICT) innovations
    systems in East Africa, expanding global perspectives within the U.S. IT workforce.\n\nFulfilling
    the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ongoing systems innovation
    to incorporate advances in foundational technologies, lower costs, and fulfill
    the needs of global data scientists. Designing systems for integration of sensor-derived
    local data into global scientific data platforms, such as the Global Open Data
    for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) hub and the International Organization for
    Migration's (IOM) Migration Data Portal, can simultaneously inform local, regional
    and global challenges of socioeconomic and environmental development. \nThis IRES
    Site Program pursues novel IoT research. The interdisciplinary research combines
    complementary wireless network, software engineering, policy studies, and sociotechnical
    systems expertise of the three mentors and the PI.  The program consists of three
    projects, two technical and one focused on policy analysis. \n\nThe first technical
    project involves unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, a.k.a. drones) designed for collecting
    data from refugee gardens. Using cameras, the UAVs collect image data processed
    through a Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), a standard approach for
    vegetation monitoring. The UAV will also be controlled by software to optimize
    its path-planning, enhancing both coverage i.e. canvassing the target area, and
    network connectivity.  The second technical project targets device-to-device communications
    (D2D) for systems without access to a power grid, through innovations in hardware,
    software and data management systems, designed to improve crop information on
    tea estates.  A third project focuses on IoT policy analyses at national and organizational
    levels. The analyses will highlight current trends in Rwandan IoT use, system
    vulnerabilities, as well as national and organizational policies that may affect
    data sharing practices and hinder access by Big Data scientists.\n\nThis IRES
    Site Program develops interdisciplinary and creative information technology professionals
    capable of solving multi-criteria design problems. Through intellectually challenging
    yet appropriately scoped projects, master's students are exposed to international
    innovation systems and gain insights into the culture of East Africa. The program's
    design includes both pre-departure and follow-on courses, insuring effective student
    preparation and widespread dissemination of results.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The scientific goal of this IRES is to gain better understanding for the fabrication of air-stable, photon upconversion thin films or liquids that can operate efficiently with diffuse sunlight, without the need of volatile organic solvents that currently limit practical use in applications.  Complete immersion in Japanese society by spending four to eight weeks in Kyushu University will provide an opportunity to experience and understand the people, traditions and culture. The cultural and scientific exposure that the U.S. students will obtain from this international collaboration will be invaluable. Kyushu University is one of the top-ranked universities in Japan, and the cosmopolitan metropolis of Fukuoka is welcoming to foreigners. This opportunity is expected to enhance the global competitiveness of the participating students in the STEM workforce, and will be made available to qualified U.S. students, especially those underrepresented in science and engineering, by broadly reaching out to the California State university system, the Univ. of California system, and students attending professional conferences organized for example, by the American Chemical Society and Materials Research Society.

    In this international collaboration, four U.S. undergraduate and/ or graduate participants per year will perform fundamental research on triplet-fusion based photon upconversion both in California and Japan. The fusion of molecular excited states with triplet character is the only method for directly upconverting photons from the sun. While these high photon upconversion quantum yields have been demonstrated in volatile organic solvents, they are generally lower in thin film due to poor triplet exciton diffusion. The U.S. students will be synthesizing and fabricating liquid or thin-films of semiconductor nanocrystals and molecular emitters organized in various hosts, including proteins, organogels and surfactants, to understand and control the diffusion of photogenerated triplet excitons. This project aims to use semiconductor nanocrystals to absorb light strongly in the near-infrared wavelengths to address one of the major limitations in molecular triplet photosensitizers. The hybrid nanomaterials will be designed to halt the spontaneous crystallization of the molecular emitter with nitrene crosslinking chemistry; increase triplet diffusion lengths in liquids or thin films with long-range order in covalent organic frameworks and establish a barrier to oxygen to prevent the quenching of spin-triplet excitons.

    Records of past climate variability from northern Europe will improve our ability to predict future environmental changes in the North Atlantic region. This IRES project will partner with premier universities in Estonia to train students in interdisciplinary field-based environmental science methods in order to develop archives of past temperature and precipitation changes from the Baltic region. Each year the project will involve initial orientations, 5 weeks of international summer field and lab-based instruction, follow-up laboratory work at home institutions during the academic year, and conference presentations in the spring. A total of 4 students (undergraduate and graduate) and 1 in-service public science teacher (RET) each year will be recruited, and all the undergraduate participants will be from 2 year colleges in northern Illinois. Students from underrepresented groups will be targeted, and at least one undergraduate student per year will be from a non-STEM background.

    This project will apply a multi-proxy approach to explore the timing and causes of historic climate variability in northern Europe. Student projects will be interrelated to develop a better understanding of how shifting Northern Hemisphere temperatures and mean-state conditions of the North Atlantic Ocean have influenced the climate dynamics of the eastern Baltic region. These datasets will serve as predictive tools for future variation across the Northern Hemisphere. Student projects will focus on lake sediment geochemistry (stable isotopes - ?18O and ?13C), paleoecology, and biology as tools to reconstruct past climate conditions. The educational goals are to: 1) Engage students in societally-relevant scientific topics to promote interest in STEM fields; 2) Mentor participants in state-of-the-art scientific research methods to better prepare them for STEM majors, careers, and advanced degrees; 3) Develop participants written and oral communication skills through mentoring and public presentations; and 4) Recruit underrepresented minority students and in-service public science teachers to promote diversity and sustainable impacts in public schools. The program components, project team, and participant experience will be rigorously evaluated by a geoscience education research specialist.

    This research project will develop a collaborative data science platform for computational social science called the Data Science Foundry. The collection and management of large-scale data currently is a relatively unstructured process, with data-processing decisions being made in an ad hoc fashion. Society has started to rely on data-driven science to address policy-related questions, however. The development of a collaborative platform that provides structure will allow social scientists to collaborate and validate each other's studies.  This project has the potential to transform how studies are designed and how data will be processed. The collaborative platform will result in a higher level of trust in the studies conducted via the collaborative curation of study design, procedures, and validation. The collaborative platform also will increase the number of studies that can be done in a short span of time. The platform will be developed as open-source, thereby facilitating interactions with the community and enabling different institutions to install the program.

    This project will develop a collaborative platform that social scientists can use to collaborate and validate each other's studies. The investigative team will attempt to identify the best possible collaborative model for data-driven social science, determine how automation can most enhance the studies, and develop explicit and implicit mechanisms to establish trust in end-to-end data processing pipelines and the results they generate. To aid in the platform's development, the research team will focus on the prediction of outcomes from surveys, a specific yet widely applicable type of problem within computational social science. This class of problems involves much subjective assessment during the feature engineering state as well as copious interpretation during the data transformation stage. These unique challenges will benefit both from a collaborative workflow and from mechanisms that enable trust in the eventual results. The project will bring together three distinct teams to develop this platform: computer scientists to develop abstractions, APIs and systems; statisticians to help with methods and study design; and social scientists to help define the problems and workflow and to provide user feedback.

    America's bridges received a C+ from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in 2017. Additionally, the US ranks only 11th world-wide in terms of infrastructure competitiveness. America's infrastructure, particularly its 50-100+ year-old bridges, is in poor health, representing a hidden crisis. Rural areas, due to their lower population density and distance from urban centers, are acutely affected by this crisis, particularly in terms of public safety and economic growth. Limited budgets for planning and maintenance only serve to exacerbate the crisis. To better inform future research, the research team held collaborative conferences and workshops, and conducted stakeholder surveys to identify issues impacting rural bridge health. Outcomes from these activities underscored the value of big data technologies to address the crisis and informed the proposed work. The mission of this multi-institution and multi-sector project is to produce a big data pipeline for rural bridge health management that improves transportation network performance and enhances safety.

    The research team will combine existing and new datasets to address challenges of relevance to bridge owners using scalable and replicable big data pipeline components. Activities will inform bridge owner decision-making by integrating existing datasets and data collected using next-generation health monitoring technologies (e.g., contact and non-contact sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles) with innovative data management techniques. Socio-technical impacts associated with potential decisions will also be assessed. Aging, rural bridge testbeds will be selected in consultation with public and private owners to produce data products that facilitate decision-making and ultimately, provide economical and reliable solutions that improve bridge health. Results from the research will be shared with engineers, owners, and builders at workshops hosted by the research team. Project findings will be disseminated through publications, conferences, meetings, and forums. The research team will engage with the Big Data Hubs and Spokes network to make data, methods, and results available across regions. By extension, project findings will also benefit activities used to monitor and manage other important infrastructure assets, including highways, buildings, power grids, offshore oil platforms, water networks, and other civil infrastructures.

    The scientific community is facing a major challenge dealing with the increasing amount of open scientific data emerging from research projects on all scales-- from large facilities to small research labs. Over the last five years the NSF has funded more than 200 high-speed connections to the Internet-2 backbone operating at 10-100Gbps speeds. The goal of this project is to develop a prototype module for a high performance distributed storage system that extends the usability of the existing high-speed interconnects. This project is a pilot for a potential national-scale storage infrastructure for open scientific data, which at full scale could serve hundred sites and many hundreds of Petabytes.  Many of the technologies associated with such a distributed system already exist; the key challenge in this project is social engineering: how can one design a simple enough yet robust storage node that can be easily replicated, is attractive for universities and research projects to adopt, is easy to manage and can support the various patterns for large scale scientific analyses?

    Many universities have several of the necessary pieces for Data Intensive Science in place-- reasonably sized computing clusters, a few PB of storage and even a high-speed connection-- yet performing the analyses of data intensive science is very painful and slow. Data is never there when needed, large storage systems often fail despite having massive RAID configurations, and moving data from disk-to-disk at the full network speed still requires complex skills. The project offers a broad community buy-in through the Big Data Hubs, a unique combination of skills, facilities and science challenges to test, evaluate and deploy different hardware and software combinations that can be used in the design of a much larger, national-scale system. The goal is to design and run detailed benchmarks for various test science projects requiring different combinations of data transfer, data processing and massive compute, and use the results to design and build a low-cost, scalable petascale appliance including inexpensive hardware nodes and a simple software stack that can be replicated across many universities, supercomputer centers and large NSF facilities. The proposed system could become an enormous multiplier on the existing NSF investments in high end computing and fast networks. It could also accelerate the pace of standardization of data storage across the nation. The public, open data products, often discussed in the Data Management Plans at the end of NSF proposals could find an easy-to-use home. Various educational projects could simply rely upon a robust storage infrastructure with a simple API, and build a variety of delivery services for the educational community.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

  title: 'EAGER: Smart Community Big Data Co-op'
- abstractText: |-
    There is a growing awareness of the need for multi-center clinical databases and multi-institutional analyses of healthcare data to ensure reproducibility and generalizability of research findings. Single-instance database algorithms are prone to three distinct problems. First, in the context of Big Data science, the size of the data compared to the number of variables makes it difficult to develop complex predictors without overfitting, and more traditional learning algorithms may lead to over-simplified models that do not capture important related influences or interactions between different types of healthcare information. Second, training and testing predictive models on a single database can lead to learning noise or other irrelevant local practices or differences in definitions that are correlated with, but not causally related to, the outcome in question. This leads to models that do not work in other institutions or in the future when practices or the environment changes. Third, sharing data between institutions, and in particular, across borders, is extremely problematic because of trust, legal issues, privacy issues and national policies. The significance of solving these issues is threefold: 1) it would allow the creating of strong generalizable data science models, which leverage enormous pools of data from around the world; 2) it would also allow the identification of rare diseases or patient types, which, as we compile databases, become less rare; and 3) perhaps most importantly, it would allow the free exchange of data science models and generalized approaches to solving medical problems in the cloud.

    This project aims to develop a set of distributed deep learning and cloud computation techniques for cross-institution and cross-border machine learning on health and medical data without the need for protected health information to leave the generating institution. The goals are to create demonstration programs which illustrate feasibility and open source the architecture. The scope of this project encompasses the broad set of machine learning-based tasks multiple institutions may want to apply to their healthcare data in the cloud, as well as the technical issues surrounding transfer learning of knowledge across domains (e.g., institutions/demographics) and tasks (e.g., types of classification and prediction problems). The project has three specific aims: 1) develop a cloud-based infrastructure which preserves regional autonomy of data, but allows the sharing of parameters of the partially trained deep neural network (including weights and hyperparameters) between regions, to allow transfer learning across domains and tasks; 2) develop a standardized coded model for deep learning approaches in medical applications; and 3) evaluate the effect of training and testing the model across multiple centers and national boundaries, by comparing improvement in performance with cross-institutional training without loss of privacy protection, using metrics of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and model calibration. Aims 1-3 will be achieved by taking four databases (including, a database of intensive care unit patients with sepsis, a free text corpus of nursing progress notes, voice recordings taken from a public corpus classically used for speaker identification, and a public database of full-face images used for classification of facial expressions) and placing them in the cloud (Google, AWS and Azure) at different geopolitical locations (namely US and Europe) and developing a distributed deep learning architecture that learns to improve its performance by sharing weights across borders, but not sensitive patient data. This project has the potential to make several contributions to the field. First, it will demonstrate that medical data across geopolitical boundaries can be made available in an interoperable manner (using the FHIR standard) and can be used for training of deep learning algorithms in a privacy-preserving manner, thus addressing both the concerns of Health Insurance, Portability and Privacy Act (HIPPA) and interoperability. Secondly, it will provide open-source deep learning algorithms for several medical datasets and data types that can be used across institutions to solve similar problems with some fine-tuning (e.g., via transfer learning). Third, it will provide a set of open-source meta algorithms for transfer learning (across domains and tasks) implemented on the cloud in containers (dockers) that can be downloaded for local use or transferred across the different cloud vendors.

    Non-technical abstract: People living in cities in all regions of the world are experiencing increases in extreme events like floods and heat waves. Urban decision makers need help to develop ways to meet this challenge that are based in scientific understanding. This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) grant is linked to the Urban Resilience to Extremes (UREx) Sustainability Research Network (SRN). The grant will support three graduate students and one undergraduate student each year for ten weeks work in Valdivia, Chile (2017); Hermosillo, Mexico (2018); and in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (2019). A total of nine UREx IRES graduate students will be trained over three years, broadening their skills in collaboration, transdisciplinary research methods, and in mentoring. They will gain appreciation for the unique challenges of Latin American cities, while benefiting from the opportunity to participate in research that is directly used by decision makers, and receive training and experience in workshop facilitation with local decision-makers and communities. Three UREx IRES undergraduate students will also gain research experience in a foreign country, learn about the process of science through not only conducting their own research project but working closely with graduate students conducting research, and gain skills in research design, data analysis and management, and presentation. This experience will help all of these students learn to work across diverse social and political cultures so that they might be more effective. The students who participate in this program will share their experiences with others in the UREx program through a reading group, blogs, and social media and at a capstone symposium to be organized in 2020 by UREx fellows.


    Technical description: Cities are highly vulnerable to extreme, weather-related events, given their location along coastlines and in drylands. As urbanization continues as the main demographic trend worldwide, an ever-greater proportion of the population is exposed to hazard. Little research has been done on Latin American cities, where strategies to enhance their resilience in the face of such events may differ from US cities owing to cultural, political, or biophysical differences. The UREx SRN is a multi-city network of scientists and local practitioners, including Latin American cities, which studies, envisions, and develops innovative solutions to the challenges of these extreme events. Linked to the UREx SRN, the UREx IRES program will train students in working across cultures and disciplines and with local decision-makers. Mentors at the host institutions are collaborators in the UREx SRN and are conducting urban resilience research in these cities. The UREx IRES will afford opportunities for nine UREx fellows to expand their dissertation research into these Latin American cities, enabling projects that can be used to compare resilient solutions between US and Latin American cities. Three UREx IRES undergraduates will be selected to work on research projects in close collaboration with the graduate students, supervised by host mentors. The students' creativity is emphasized: as part of the UREx SRN they will have had experience with interdisciplinary research, training on Latin American cities, and will write a short research proposal that explains how their IRES project will integrate with their dissertation research and contribute to the overall knowledge-to-action efforts in the host city. UREx IRES fellows will be conducting transdisciplinary research with practitioners and host mentors that will advance basic scientific understanding of the characteristics of urban areas in general and infrastructure in particular that will lead to more resilient, and ultimately sustainable, cities in the future.

    This three-year International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will annually send six U.S. students (two graduate students and four undergraduates) for eight weeks to conduct research in the hadron physics group at the Institut de Physique Nucléaire d'Orsay (IPN- Orsay) in Orsay, France.  The research projects will come from a wide range of subjects in nuclear physics including detector development, data analysis and software development.   A particular emphasis will be made to recruit women and minority participants from institutions in New England and Southern Virginia. This program will enable the students to develop collaborative thinking and communication skills in an international working environment, establish a global network with foreign scientists, and gain insight into a future career.  This program emerges from the beliefs that international collaboration will advance scholarship by stimulating global perspectives, and that students must be prepared for their careers in the increasingly globally engaged working environment of the future.

    A major focus of modern nuclear physics concerns how protons, neutrons, and atomic nuclei are made of quarks and gluons, the fundamental degrees of freedom of quantum chromodynamics. Modern studies of the nucleon structure are conducted at large-scale nuclear research facilities by large collaborations with a significant international component. This project supports US student participation in the ongoing research activities of the hadron physics group at the Institut de Physique Nucléaire d?Orsay (IPN- Orsay).  The planned projects include (1) detection efficiency studies of a neutron detector, (2) development of a nuclear fragment detector, (3) studies of the particle channeling via bent crystals, (4) performance studies of MWPC (Multi-Wire Proportional Chamber) and GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) detectors, (5) performance studies of diamond detectors, and (6) software development of 3-D modeling of the nucleon structure.  US student participation in these projects supports the development of a globally trained competitive workforce at the forefront of nuclear physics.

- abstractText: "The International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) is a collaboration of
    astronomers who will use radio telescopes to detect and study gravitational waves,
    a  fundamental prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Gravitational
    waves (GW) from the merger of two stellar-mass black holes were recently detected
    by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The IPTA collaboration
    will detect GW from vastly larger and heavier black holes at the cores of merging
    galaxies, via the precise timing of cosmic clocks called radio pulsars. The astronomers
    anticipate that low-frequency GW will be detected within the next five years,
    ushering in a revolution in our understanding of the growth and structure of our
    Universe. U.S. undergraduate and graduate students will be fully involved in all
    aspects of the project. They will collaborate with prominent scientists in different
    countries, play a critical role in one of the potentially transformative scientific
    discoveries of the century, and develop global competencies to succeed in today's
    interconnected world.\n \nThe project will monitor a number of radio pulsars using
    a network of large radio telescopes distributed across the globe, and search for
    small perturbations in the arrival times of pulsar pulses due to low-frequency
    gravitational waves. The IPTA currently consists of consortia from Australia,
    Europe, and North America, using a total of seven telescopes. In order to further
    increase the sensitivity of the IPTA so that it can detect and, ultimately, characterize
    the GW universe, the collaboration will be expanded to include researchers and
    telescopes in China, India, and South Africa. This expansion offers the opportunity
    for U.S. students to gain experience in the development of pulsar timing programs
    in these varied countries. The IRES award will fund two undergraduate students
    and one graduate student to travel to all three countries for 10-week international
    research experiences. The undergraduate students will be drawn from a range of
    U.S. institutions, including minority serving institutions and those in rural
    areas. They will work closely with both a U.S. graduate student also trained in
    IPTA research and their foreign mentor and students in the host country. The students
    will be trained in astrophysics, big data analysis, and radio instrumentation,
    preparing them for a range of careers."

- abstractText: "This project will evaluate sediments deposited 300-million years
    ago in France at a time of abundant ice on the planet. This project will engage
    several teams of undergraduates from underserved populations - particularly indigenous
    peoples of the Plains and Southwest states - in scientific research within a culturally
    sensitive context. A total of 13 students will travel to France over three years
    to conduct field and lab work on red sediments analogous to the types of sediments
    and landscapes familiar to them in the U.S. They will work with both U.S. and
    French scientists in collecting data in both the field and the laboratory, while
    also learning about the history and culture of a part of France with a geologic
    history analogous to that of their homeland. This project will further our understanding
    of how Earth's surface conditions can behave under conditions analogous to the
    present. \n\nThis IRES project will involve three student groups per year undertaking
    fieldwork in France. Students will test the hypothesis that Carboniferous-Permian
    strata of basins preserved near the Central Pangaean Mountains (France) archive
    a record of moderate-elevation glaciation and widespread loess deposits in the
    paleo-tropics. One PhD student and 4 undergraduates per year will participate
    in this project, and students from underserved groups, particularly indigenous
    peoples of the Plains and Southwest states, will be encouraged to participate.
    These students will conduct fieldwork to document facies attributes, including
    detailed grain-size analyses, quartz microtextural, geochemical, and geochronological
    analyses in discrete projects that when merged will test the overarching hypothesis.
    The proposed research will contribute to the experience base and expertise in
    sedimentologic/geochemical/geochronological analyses for all participants, while
    developing datasets and results that will be disseminated largely by student participants.
    Students from the Native populations will be drawn into a foreign experience that
    will widen their horizons, yet simultaneously demonstrate a place-based learning
    wherein stories of past climates are teased from studies of the land. Results
    will provide important constraints on paleoclimate of tropical eastern Pangaea.
    Support of the hypothesis would require a large shift in long-accepted reconstructions
    of climate in eastern Pangaea, whereas a failure of the hypothesis will require
    renewed efforts to understand meridional climate states across central Pangaea.
    The Late Paleozoic Ice Age is Earth?s most recent pre-Quaternary glaciation, and
    thus a common target for climate modelers, using the same models as those employed
    for climate prediction. Hence, calibrations to these models are critical for understanding
    broader aspects of Earth's climate system in both deep- and near-time intervals.
    In summary, the intellectual merit of this project lies in testing hypotheses
    of Earth?s deep-time climate behavior in order to refine our knowledge of Earth's
    climate system, including future states.  The broader impacts include providing
    students of underserved populations research opportunities that will help cultivate
    interest in science and forge new international collaborations."

- abstractText: "Nontechnical Abstract:\nWe have entered the era of ubiquitous computing,
    an era defined by interconnected devices embedded in everyday objects that become
    part of everyday activities. Ubiquitous computing, or ubicomp, is a multidisciplinary
    field of study that explores the design and implementation of embedded, networked
    computing devices. Interactions with the computational devices of the developing
    ubicomp world are challenging. Ubicomp researchers explore natural interactions
    with devices, using modalities such as speech, gaze, gestures, and touch. With
    these modes of interaction, the user's focus can remain primarily on the world
    surrounding the device. Human-computer interaction is a central issue in ubicomp,
    and it will be the focus of the work of the IRES students who will conduct research
    at two locations in Germany: at the University of Stuttgart, and at the University
    of Oldenburg. \n\nTechnical Abstract:\nOur research will explore human-computer
    interaction in three areas of ubicomp: in-vehicle interactions, interactions with
    large displays, and interactions with devices on a ship bridge. We will explore
    user interfaces for highly automated vehicles, those that can take over all control
    of the vehicle for extended periods of time, and will signal well in advance when
    the driver needs to resume control. In these future vehicles, drivers will have
    ample time to devote to non-driving tasks. The design of the user interfaces will
    have less to do with the driver?s attention to the road (as is the case in today?s
    vehicles), and more with the physical characteristics of the vehicle (size, seating
    arrangement), the characteristics of the computing environment (network speed,
    quality of sensor readings), and the presence of other people in the vehicle and
    even in other vehicles (collaboration with other passengers, and distractions
    due to the activities of other passengers). Our goal is to explore how context
    should shape the design of in-vehicle user interfaces for automated vehicles.
    In our work with interfaces for ship bridges we will evaluate how to design interfaces
    that keep the human operator?s attention on the relevant interfaces and on the
    outside world, such that the operator can safely navigate the vessel. Our goal
    is to explore how to visualize relevant entities that are outside of the operator?s
    visual focus, and how to guide the operator?s shift of attention towards these
    entities for navigation and decision making. Finally, our work with large displays
    will explore the relationships between the characteristics of the user interfaces
    such as mode of interaction and context awareness, and measures such as user satisfaction,
    task completion time, and task completion quality. Our overarching goal is to
    establish some of these relationships, and use the results to propose improved
    designs of interactions with large displays."

- abstractText: "The near-surface roof of volcanic systems is often considered geologically
    simple. Lava erupts from depth and flows out at the surface. This project examines
    whether the evolution of the system is more complex, with multiple injections
    of molten rock over time transported vertically and laterally toward and away
    from the central vent of the volcano. Documentation of these patterns could indicate
    that this more complex model may be the norm, leading to a transformative discovery
    of the most abundant volcanic constructs on Earth. The project will also study
    whether primary features of the roots of volcanic systems are often preserved,
    providing a mechanism to track the growth of the deeper parts of the volcanic
    system. At least 15 students from New Mexico Highlands University - a Hispanic
    Serving Institution - and other participating universities - also Hispanic Serving
    Institutions - will study volcanic systems in the Czech Republic to achieve the
    project goal of fully characterizing the anatomy of volcanoes from the deep roots
    to the near-surface roof. Geology graduate and undergraduate students will expand
    their research skills by working collaboratively with an international team of
    geologists. A small team of media arts students from underrepresented backgrounds
    will document the project to share the overall experience of international research
    with a broad audience through public outreach programs. \n\nThrough this 3-year
    project, undergraduate and graduate students will use a unique multidisciplinary
    approach to geologic investigation that involves field- and laboratory-based research
    to better understand and challenge long-standing volcano growth models. While
    building their research experience, the students will advance understanding of
    volcano anatomy. In the Jièín Volcanic Field in the Central Bohemian Paradise
    (Èeský ráj), Czech Republic, natural erosion and quarrying activities from medieval
    times through today have unearthed many volcanoes to expose levels between 100
    m to 4 km below the original surface of the volcano. Teamed with mentors from
    the Czech Republic, France, and Poland students will interpret the magma flow
    pattern, as well as the physical process of dike intrusion, cryptodome formation,
    and magma breakout at the surface. In terms of the roots of the system, students
    will focus on well-exposed, deeply eroded volcanic-plutonic systems near Prague
    and in the northeast Czech Republic. The project team will use methods such as:
    1) primary field observations, structural measurements, sample collection for
    petrology, economic ore genesis, paleomagnetic, and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility
    analysis; and 2) geophysical surveys to map the subsurface structure. Team experts
    contribute skills sets including physical volcanology, volcanostratigraphy, geochemistry,
    exploration geophysics, magma emplacement mechanics, structural geology, and economic
    ore mineralization. Collectively, these analytical tools will be used to evaluate
    the volcanic system in the field and a laboratory setting. Engaging the skills
    of underrepresented media arts students in documenting the learning and research
    process will contribute to building the next generation of media arts and geology
    students, instilling in them a sense of global competency.\n\nThis project is
    co-funded by the Directorate for Geosciences, Division of Earth Sciences."

    Talamanca (GREAT) project will use a diverse array of geoscience methods to investigate
    the origins, the current state, and the hazard potential of the Cordillera Talamanca
    (CT) in southern Costa Rica. This region is unique in Central America because
    of its lack of active volcanism, its extreme (and geologically recent) high elevations,
    and its history of unusually distributed large earthquakes. \n\nThe project will
    use resources of the University of Costa Rica: The School of Geology and the civil
    engineering research center (Laboratorio Nacional de Materiales y Modelos Estructurales,
    LanammeUCR,), and also the research facilities of the national power company of
    Costa Rica (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, ICE).\n\nOver the course
    of three years, 18 undergraduate students will participate in the project. They
    will collect new data on seismic wave propagation, gravity field strength, and
    the shape of the Earth's surface. They will  merge new observations with existing
    data into a unified knowledge base to increase understanding of the region. They
    will analyze combined data sets to answer specific questions about this region,
    such as \"Why are Cordillera Talamanca so high?\", \"Where are zones of present
    internal deformation?\", and \"What factors control slope stability?\", and use
    newly gained knowledge to assess landslide hazards along the Pan-American highway
    in the CT. \n\nIntegration of the GREAT project into the university-wide Aresty

    research and educational institution in Central America (University of Costa Rica).
    \ \n\n\nTechnical abstract\n\nThe Geoscience REsearch At the Cordillera Talamanca
    (GREAT) research and education project will pursue three distinct research avenues.\n\n1.\tWe
    will study the interior structure of the Cordillera Talamanca region through a
    combination of gravity and seismic methods. Improved constraints on the distribution
    of density will come from a) better gravity data; and b) the integration of additional
    constraints on the geometry and chemistry of Earth's crust. These constraints
    will be inferred from the seismic structure of the Cordillera Talamanca based
    on a combination of methods using body waves from local and distant earthquakes.
    We will use teleseismic receiver function (RF) analysis to probe the structure
    of the crust and the upper mantle, and will take advantage of numerous local and
    regional earthquakes to constrain absolute values of seismic wave speed with textbook
    geophysical exploration techniques such as seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection.
    \ \n\n2.\tWe will study the present-day deformation within the region using regional
    earthquake data from existing and newly deployed seismic observatories.  We will
    work to improve the location of regional seismicity by a) including additional
    data, b) using more advanced tools such as double-difference location, and c)
    using better models of seismic velocity in the Earth.  \n\n3.\tWe will investigate
    the landslide hazard potential for the Pan-American Highway within Cordillera
    Talamanca using remote sensing data and direct geological observations. We will
    use unmanned drones and land-based LiDAR to build highly detailed digital elevation
    models, and will combine them with microgravity surveys and background information
    on geology and seismic activity to develop case studies of landslide potential.\n\nDuring
    each of 3 years of the project a six-person cohort of undergraduate students will
    spend 6 weeks in Costa Rica, working with mentors from research institutions in
    the country. Students will collect new data and perform basic data processing
    and analysis tasks while in Costa Rica, and will develop individualized research
    projects over the course of subsequent academic year, when they will be enrolled
    in a university-wide Aresty Research Assistantship program."

  title: 'IRES: U.S.-Turkey: International Research Experience for Students in Electrified
    and Autonomous Transportation Systems'
- abstractText: |-
    This award supports a collaboration between George Mason University (GMU) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).  Through this project, eighteen undergraduate students (six per year) will participate in a nine-week Summer research and training experience at CERN. CERN is among the most vibrant and international research centers in the world. Its scientific instruments - accelerators and detectors - are some of the largest and most technically complex ever built. All aspects of accelerator-focused research and design are carried out there.  While fundamental particle physics is CERN's primary mission, active work is also undertaken in nuclear, molecular, and atomic physics, as well as detector and accelerator design and computing methods and infrastructure. Participating students will attend a one-week orientation and training workshop at GMU, and then spend eight weeks at CERN undertaking research projects related to CERN's particle accelerators and detectors. The students are guided in their research by internationally-trained, CERN-affiliated scientists, engineers, or computer specialists, and are co-supervised by the PI. Participants are part of CERN?s Summer Student Programme, which hosts nearly 300 undergraduates from around Europe and other countries. For participating students, this is an international learning and networking experience that may very well turn out to be among the highlights of their academic careers.

    Principal Investigator Rubin is a member of the NA62 collaboration, a group of about 200 physicists from Europe, Russia, and North America, which is investigating ultra-rare kaon decays in a fixed target experiment using beam from CERN?s Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).  IRES participants may indicate preferences for work in any of the research areas available at CERN.  In this project, participants will be advanced STEM students recruited from US academic institutions with a highly diverse student body. At the conclusion of their Summer experiences, the student researchers will complete a presentation and a technical note reporting their research results.

    of an agroforestry system. The highlands were returned to indigenous (Kadazan)
    persons in Malaysian Borneo following two clear-cuttings over the last century;
    and the agroforestry system is designed to restore the forest canopy. Eleven undergraduate
    and two Master of Science students from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines
    will collect data in paid 8-week summer ecological field research experiences.
    Data include soil properties (organic matter, chemical content, pH, water holding
    capacity, fungi to bacteria ratio), arthropod diversity (beetles, ants and butterflies)
    and fructivorous and insectivorous bat communities. \n\nThe data record ecological
    changes at producer sites and will be compared to sites at the same elevation
    in an adjacent and protected national forest range for ecological benchmarking.
    \ Benchmarking serves to help qualify agroforestry practices for international
    green product labelling, which would substantially elevate producer incomes. Results
    will improve scientific understanding of the linkages among ecological communities
    in tropical forests from soil to canopy; and, finally, students will gain professional

    to civil and environmental engineering students who are making the transition
    from undergraduate-to-graduate study.  Participants will conduct research within
    one of the leading water engineering units in the world, in some of the finest
    labs globally, and within extremely complex environments. They will tackle one
    of three environmental fluid mechanics project areas using field measurements,
    physical modeling, and numerical methods: 1) Coastal hazard mitigation ecosystem
    services; 2) Contaminant remediation; and 3) River bed destruction.  Each of these
    areas connect to ongoing research at the University of Queensland sponsored by
    major government, nonprofit, and industry agencies.  \n\nAs the strain on water
    resources and ecosystems intensifies, it is becoming increasingly important to
    educate engineers to be ready to face complex issues related to water monitoring
    and management that stretch across national boundaries.  The field of water engineering
    requires a broader educational approach beyond traditional curricula, as today's
    water engineers face challenging and interdisciplinary issues that combine concepts
    and methods beyond existing theories and data and instead require a research focus.
    \ In addition to the water engineering research component, this IRES program will
    make important contributions to water engineering education more broadly, as it
    will produce research focused on how to enhance the education of water engineers
    and how and why students develop in these kinds of international research experiences."

    Materials innovation is a pipeline, deriving from a deep understanding and control of material behavior and properties, leading to advanced materials designs that advance economic prosperity, address national and regional energy needs, and bolster national security. Improving this pipeline requires connecting independent but thematically congruent national and regional materials design efforts to align key stakeholders, consolidate diverse materials data expertise, simplify data access, coalesce on topics of data description and interoperability, enhance and ensure the quality of datasets, and deploy scalable data services to support materials researchers. The Midwest Big Data Spoke (MBD Spoke) for Integrative Materials Design (IMaD) connects researchers in industry, universities, and government to the people and services needed to easily find, access, and use data, tools, and services for materials design. The Midwest is the ideal place for such a program. Many major national materials design efforts funded by DOE, NIST, and NSF as part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) operate in the Midwest, and the Midwest is home to major manufacturing industries that depend critically on materials innovation for their continued competitiveness.

    The technical work of IMaD will involve integration of software and services from across the Midwest and beyond, including the Materials Commons, the Materials Data Facility, NIST Materials Resource Registry, and Citrine Informatics, to enable smooth flow of software and data among these different systems. For example, integrated authentication provided by Globus Auth will enable access to different components with common credentials (e.g., institutional credentials), and integration of Globus transfer will allow for rapid and reliable exchange of large datasets. Common schemas and metadata terms will be developed and deployed to permit cross-system searching and display of information. Materials data from partners across the Midwest and beyond will be loaded into the Material Data Facility to permit easy discovery and access. Concurrently with these and other development activities, a series of workshops and meetings will be convened to engage academic, government, and industry participants in defining requirements for, and making use of, the integrated system for materials design.

    opportunities for women and students from under-represented groups. Many of the
    California State University  and the University of California campuses in Southern
    California, where the U.S. students will be recruited, are Hispanic Serving Institutions
    and Minority Serving Institutions. The project will have societal benefits by
    promoting mutual understandings between the two nations.\n \nThe aim of the project
    is to give U.S. students international research experiences under the mentorship
    of a prominent Uzbek mathematician, Shavkat Ayupov, a well-known expert in Leibniz
    algebras. The PI will take three separate cohorts to Uzbekistan, 15 to 21 U.S.
    students over three years, to conduct research for two months at the Institute
    of Mathematics of the National University of Uzbekistan. The U.S. students will
    join Ayupov's research group and conduct research in collaboration with their
    Uzbek peers and mentors on topics of current interest in Leibniz algebras. Examples
    of research topics include studying properties of derivations of Leibniz algebras
    and identifying solvable rigid Leibniz algebras. The Leibniz algebras, which are
    generalizations of Lie algebras, are an important and rapidly developing area
    of mathematics with applications in general relativity, quantum mechanics and
    string theory. It is expected for each research project to result in publications
    and lead to further research collaboration. In addition to their research activities,
    the students will also take short courses on the language, culture and traditions
    of Uzbekistan to help them adjust to their surroundings. During their stay in
    Uzbekistan, the U.S. students will travel to the ancient cities of Samarkand,
    Bukhara and Khiva to learn about the cultural and scientific heritage of Uzbekistan."

    Bats are capable of swift, autonomous navigation through complex, natural environments - a feat that cannot be replicated by engineers at present. The central hypothesis behind this research is that system-level synergies between sensing, mobility, and control functions are critical factors behind achieving these unmatched capabilities of bats. To understand how these system-level synergies arise in nature, participating students will be advised by faculty teams spanning six departments to conduct interdisciplinary research projects centered on one of the following topics: acoustical scene statistics of natural bat habitats, dynamic biosonar sensing, maneuvering flight, neural control, physiological basis of sound emission and reception. All student projects will be based in the Shandong University - Virginia Tech International Laboratory in China.

    The educational outcomes of the project will be undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary skills between biology and engineering that will allow them to interpret biological functions from an engineering perspective and within their respective biological contexts. Furthermore, the IRES trainees will acquire intercultural competencies to work effectively in international teams. The project's scientific outcomes will enable engineers to design better integrated autonomous systems, e.g., self-navigating drones, that will have bat-like capabilities to deal with natural, unconstrained environments, such dense vegetation.

    power grid is a rapidly emerging Big Data (BD) presence. The American Recovery
    and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 allocated over $4 billion to deployment of
    new technology for grid monitoring, control and infrastructure protection.  This
    led to a dramatic proliferation in the use of Big Data across multiple operational
    domains such as generation, transmission and distribution, customers, services,
    and markets. A challenging goal is to convert Big Data in smart grids, which is
    overwhelmingly abundant and yet grossly underutilized, into new knowledge that
    can offer major improvements in the above mentioned domains of smart grid operation,
    including management of almost a trillion dollars in grid infrastructure annually
    and an increase in building energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020. The Smart
    Grids BD (SGBD) Spoke will build an action-oriented organization focused on developing
    the fundamental framework for BD integration and knowledge extraction for power
    system applications. This will enable the South Big Data Hub to meet the societal
    grand challenge of creating technological solutions that can fulfill the economic
    potential inherent in Big Data analytics in the electric utility industry, expected
    to reach an annual value of close to $4 billion by 2020. The Project mission is
    to complement, strengthen, and serve the South Hub regional priority areas. Moreover,
    the services of the Spoke will benefit and complement the other Hub regional priority
    areas dependent on a smart grid backbone for operational assurance and resilience,
    specifically the areas of Oil and Gas Production and Distribution, National Hazards
    (Coastal and Other Hazards), Materials and Manufacturing, Habitat Planning (Smart
    and Connected Communities, Transportation, Urban Infrastructure and Sustainability)
    and Education and Training.  \n\nThe significance of Smart Grids Big Data is in
    the diversity of its sources, growth rate, and spatiotemporal characteristics.
    Developing a fundamental framework for Big Data integration and knowledge extraction
    is a grand challenge since the science and technology are yet to be discovered
    and the theoretical framework established. The main objective is to create an
    organization that brings together a cross disciplinary capability from academia,
    industry, and government, thereby (a) bringing  talent and resources from diverse
    Big Data areas to create an open access Big Data infrastructure that enables collaboration
    and innovation; (b) engaging industry to define its challenges and implement new
    Big Data technologies for cost-effective computational, analytical, and data management
    solutions needed to get the full benefits of smart grids; and (c) establishing
    close collaboration with the South Hub to find the most effective way to develop
    outreach, education, and training, thereby assuring the SGBD SPOKE domain integrates
    synergistically with the other Hub domains to advance fundamental data science
    and its impacts.   Achieving the knowledge extraction from Smart Grids Big Data
    will result in the advancement of fundamental sciences in multiple disciplinary
    domains related to Big Data analytics. It will also increase our understanding
    of merged data collected from the physical systems, thereby helping us better
    understand the flow of energy in the smart grids, and how this understanding can
    prevent emergencies, improve asset management, and increase energy efficiency.
    It will also provide a more illuminated understanding of behavioral analytics
    that addresses the human interface with smart electricity systems. The expected
    transformational outcomes are: (a) solutions to decreasing the grid outages, improving
    energy and market efficiency, reducing carbon emissions, and engaging industry
    and customers in new business models to ensure industry growth, operational resiliency,
    and customer value, (b) a cross cutting research community focused on solving
    practical problems while concurrently advancing the fundamental understanding
    of Big Data issues; and (c)  engaging  novel instructional paradigms for educating
    and training the next generation of Big Data experts  nationally and globally."

    Vast quantities of health, environmental, and behavioral data are being generated today, yet they remain locked in digital silos. For example, data from health care providers, such as hospitals, provide a dynamic view of health of individuals and populations from birth to death. At the same time, government institutions and industry have released troves of economic, environmental, and behavioral datasets, such as indicators of income/poverty, adverse exposure (e.g., air pollution), and ecological factors (e.g., climate) to the public domain. How are economic, environmental, and behavioral factors linked with health? This project will put together numerous sources of large environmental and clinical data streams to enable the scientific community to address this question. By breaking current data silos, the broader scientific impacts will be wide. First, this effort will foster new routes of biomedical investigation for the big data community. Second, the project will enable discoveries that will have behavioral, economic, environmental, and public health relevance.

    This project will aim to assemble a first-ever data warehouse containing numerous health/clinical, environmental, behavioral, and economic data streams to ultimately enable causal discovery between these data sources. First, the team will integrate numerous health data streams by leveraging the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, www.ohdsi.org) network, a virtual data repository that contains millions of longitudinal patient measurements, such as drugs and disease diagnoses. Second, the team will build a centralized data warehouse that contains important environmental, behavioral, and economic data across the United States, such as the Environmental Protection Agency air pollution AirData, the United States Census data on income and occupation statistics, and the National Oceanic Administration Association for climate and weather-related information. Third, the team will disseminate emerging computational methods for causal inference and machine learning to enable researchers to find causal links between environmental, economic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The team will leverage our broad collaborative network consisting of academic big data researchers, federal-level institutes (e.g., EPA, NOAA), and hospitals (e.g., Partners HealthCare) to integrate these data and to disseminate cutting edge machine learning tools. Lastly, the project will create training resources (e.g., interactive how-to guides), coordinate cross-institution student internships, and lead a hands-on workshop to demonstrate use of the integrated data warehouse. The ultimate goal of the project is to facilitate community-led and collaborative causal discovery through dissemination of integrated and open big data and analytics tools.

    Title: IRES: International research experience for students on the behavioral ecology and conservation of African carnivores

    Nontechnical abstract
    This international research training program allows advanced undergraduates and junior graduate students to spend extended periods conducting field research on free-living African carnivores in Kenya, building on a strong long-term program of carnivore research in the Masai Mara National Reserve. Several students each year will undertake projects designed to acquire new and useful information about the carnivores inhabiting the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, and to develop strong, long-lasting professional relationships with Kenyan scientists. A strong team of American and Kenyan trainers will help students address a broad array of research questions about the behavior, conservation and physiology of African carnivores, ranging from the evolution of their cognitive abilities to the effects of human activity on their stress physiology. Pairs of undergraduate and graduate students will be linked by topical research focus, and work closely with local experts. While in Kenya, students will receive explicit training in science writing, and present their work at an annual conference on carnivore biology sponsored by the Kenya Wildlife Service. The research opportunities offered to students here are unparalleled, not only to investigate the biology of several carnivore species that remain very poorly understood, but also to make important contributions to behavioral ecology, stress physiology and conservation biology. The knowledge acquired in this research should facilitate conservation of African carnivores, and thus contribute to the economic well-being of Kenya, which is intimately linked with revenues from eco-tourism. This research program will also contribute significantly to the professional development of a new generation of global scientists who are united in their desire to understand and protect the natural world.

    Technical abstract
    The intellectual focus of this project is the behavioral ecology, physiology, and conservation of African carnivores.  Mammalian carnivores are critical to the stability and integrity of ecosystems around the world, largely because they play key roles in regulating such important ecosystem processes as interspecific competition and predator-prey dynamics.  Despite their importance, however, carnivores are in global decline due to a combination of habitat degradation and direct human persecution. In fact, today many carnivore populations are declining even within protected areas. It has become clear in recent years that our ability to conserve mammalian carnivores, including most of those in Africa, is limited by a dearth of knowledge about many aspects of their basic biology. This international research training program aims to fill these gaps in our knowledge in regard to African carnivores, and to apply that new knowledge to improving carnivore management; this program should thus ultimately facilitate carnivore conservation across the African continent. During the proposed funding period, students will use experimental and observational methods to test hypotheses suggesting 1) relationships among social complexity, foraging demands and general intelligence, 2) endocrine substrates of cooperative behavior, 3) how anthropogenic activities affect the behavior, physiology and demography of mammalian carnivores, and 4) best carnivore management practices. This is the only training program in the United States where both undergraduate and graduate students can obtain field research experience investigating the biology of free-living African carnivores. Most past participants in this program have reported their experiences in Kenya to be life-changing, setting them on trajectories of professional development they otherwise never would have dreamed possible.

- abstractText: "This proposal focuses on providing international educational and
    research opportunities in geosciences for US students and underrepresented minorities
    in a non-traditional study abroad destination, in this case Ethiopia. Only 4%
    of international undergraduate student research experiences are in Africa. Recent
    research has documented the benefits of these international experiences including:
    increased knowledge of other cultures, world geography, cultural relativism, and
    global interdependence. Students in general show increasing enthusiasm about problems
    of global importance that have practical consequences and are strongly attracted
    to interdisciplinary courses, especially those of societal relevance. The collaborations
    in this proposal will aid the effort of developing a globally engaged workforce
    in the US and provide the opportunity for students to tackle problems of global
    magnitude as members of the world community. This project can have a significant
    impact on the participation of U.S. students in geosciences education and research
    at both participating U.S. institutions. We expect that students participating
    in the international study, research training program and field experience abroad
    will acquire knowledge and research skills in geosciences and will be encouraged
    to pursue academic and/or industrial careers in these areas. The scientists and
    students at North Carolina A&T University (NCA&T) and in Ethiopia are benefiting
    from the collaboration, as they are now developing long lasting relationships
    that create the conditions for joint global projects. \n\nEthiopia serves as an
    ideal natural laboratory for training US students in the geosciences. The main
    Ethiopian Rift and the Afar Depression region is the only location on earth, other
    than Iceland, where the transition from continental to oceanic rift is being studied.
    The East African Rift System crossing through Ethiopia is one the geologic wonders
    of the world, a place where the earth's tectonic forces are presently trying to
    create new plates by splitting apart old ones.  Ethiopia and sub-Saharan Africa
    is also home to some of the highest levels of atmospheric aerosols from biomass-burning
    (BB) and BB is believed to be a major driver of regional carbon, energy, and water
    cycles. Selected IRES students will work alongside research mentors from NCA&T,
    Addis Ababa University (AAU) and Appalachian State University (ASU) and student
    researchers from AAU to (1) conduct geophysics research including exploring geothermal
    energy and groundwater sources; (2) initiate long-term measurements of atmospheric
    aerosols in Addis Ababa; and (3) conduct laboratory-based studies of BB aerosol
    optical properties (4) apply Fourier Transform spectroscopic techniques to develop
    carbon monoxide (CO) emission inventories. The proposed activities build upon
    existing research capabilities at the three universities and collaborations between
    NCA&T and AAU, which have involved numerous US undergraduates in international
    research experiences. The research experiences will be conducted in a region of
    the world that serves as an ideal natural geoscience laboratory (Earth and atmospheric
    sciences) and which has traditionally been neglected for international student
    research opportunities. U.S. student participants will work alongside AAU students
    and faculty researchers who are leaders in their field on interdisciplinary geoscience
    projects that will instill Earth system science approach and have societal implications,
    including geothermal energy, water resources, plate tectonics, and relationships
    between regional air quality and climate change."

    Name: Erdogmus, Ece\n \n\nProposal Title:\tU.S.-Turkey Research Collaboration
    in Conservation Engineering\nInstitution:\tUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln (Omaha
    Campus)\nAbstract Date:\t03/24/16\n\nRehabilitation of historical/existing structures
    is an area ripe for research.  With an increasing number of aging structures in
    the United States, there is a growing need for workforce development to address
    the potential for historic preservation in coming years.  The goal of this project
    is to develop a cadre of experts with specialized training and global awareness
    in the engineering aspects of historical preservation projects.  To address this
    need, Dr. Erdogmus from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will collaborate with
    the Izmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH) of Turkey.  This 3-year program will
    bring a group of nine US students to Turkey for a seven-week summer research in
    historic preservation engineering.  It is the intention of the PI to recruit at
    least 50% of the cohort each year from underrepresented groups.  The Turkish mentors
    from IZTECH are Dr. Mine Turan and Dr. Engin Aktas, representing the Architectural
    Restoration and Civil Engineering Departments, respectively.  Under the experienced
    leadership of the hosts and the PI, the US students participating in the program
    will be provided with meaningful and comprehensive research experiences comprised
    of lab-work at IZTECH campus and a variety of field-applications that involve
    historical sites. \n\nThis three year U.S.-Turkey IRES program will involve American
    graduate and undergraduate students in research projects at the interface of structural
    engineering and conservation with three focus themes: 1) Engineering- conservation
    coordination for assessment of historical structures and materials prior to an
    intervention, 2) Engineering- conservation coordination for the development of
    compatible materials for historical retrofits, and 3) Post-Intervention assessment
    and risk analysis for the collapse-safety of structures. Under each of these focus
    themes, the IRES students will conduct specific projects and tasks; namely, the
    students will: a) Develop a novel method to provide a closed feedback loop on
    complex sites, which involves a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) based rating system
    for each element correlating the visual assessments to its interior damage levels.
    \ This will then inform variant constitutive models and aid in the design for
    the conservation intervention. b) Investigate chemical and mechanical properties
    of modern cements from different locations in order to evaluate their behavior
    under extreme heat, salt water, and freeze-thaw cycles when paired with different
    historical stones. c) Develop a decision making algorithm for historical structures
    using probabilistic assessments and sensitivity analyses to identify safety concerns
    and to predict design event recurrence intervals for which a given structure remains
    safe. This algorithm will then support decisions for or against intervention,
    ensuring only a minimum level of invasive intervention applied to the historic
    site. This work is funded by the IRES program of NSF Office of International Science
    and Engineering (OISE)."

    research experiences for US engineering students to work at the globally recognized
    5th Generation Cellular Systems Innovation Centre (5GIC) at the University of
    Surrey, U.K. In each of its three years, the twelve-week program supported by
    this project will provide five (2 graduate, and 3 undergraduate) students an opportunity
    to work closely with an internationally renowned research group in three focused
    research areas within the domain of next generation ultra-dense wireless cellular

    This project will also provide participants an opportunity for a hands on research
    experience using a one of a kind, outdoor, large scale 5G test-bed for wireless
    cellular system innovation that has recently been established at the University
    of Surrey as part of 5GIC.  Ultra-dense deployment of cellular systems is inevitable

- abstractText: "IRES: Vertically Integrated Team for Structural DNA NanoTech in Denmark\n\n\tThis
    project sponsors a vertically integrated team (diverse members from education
    levels spanning high school through post-doctoral) of 5 or 6 participants per
    year from North Carolina for travel to Aarhus University in Denmark to pursue
    month-long research projects. Scientifically, the research project will advance
    the engineering of biological macromolecules (DNA and proteins) for formation
    of materials with their structures controlled on the nanometer length scale. The
    team leader will recruit participants from groups commonly underrepresented in
    science and engineering disciplines including minority and female students. This
    international research training experience will provide participants with unique
    opportunities to enlarge their scientific networks and to experience first-hand
    the benefits of cultural mixing. The project is important and deserves NSF funding,
    because it will develop molecular tools as well as scientific personnel capable
    of advancing nanoscience goals critical to the electronics and medical fields.
    US participants will benefit from significant scientific and social interactions
    with foreign students and faculty on-site in Denmark. The project will produce
    significant outcomes including cutting-edge research results and impactful research
    training experiences for participating American students. The senior investigators
    involved have received funding through the Danish National Research Foundation
    which primarily funds Danish students both in Denmark and on visits to the NCSU
    lab. IRES funding complements the Danish investment by allowing US students to
    participate in research at Aarhus.\n\n\tThe project's scientific focus will be
    on the development of self-assembling DNA nanostructures and on their application
    toward nanofabrication of electronic, photonic, and biomedical devices. The NCSU
    team has used DNA as a building material to implement molecular computers, and
    to organize proteins and metallic nanoparticles with molecular-scale precision,
    while the Aarhus team is expert in DNA-guided chemistry for programmed synthesis
    of very large organic molecules. Developing ways to control matter on the nanoscale
    by exploiting the same construction principles used by biology (i.e. molecular
    recognition) holds great promise for diverse nanofabrication and biomedical applications.
    Engineered supramolecular complexes comprised of DNA, polypeptides, and inorganic
    nanomaterials provide the right length scale, range of physicochemical interactions,
    and complexity of shapes for interfacing effectively with biological structures.
    As such, DNA nanotechnology represents a perfect approach for creating custom
    diagnostic and ?smart? therapeutic agents for medical applications. Likewise,
    these same principles and materials are ideal for developing bionanofabrication
    procedures to compete with lithography for generation of electronic devices and
    circuits. Pursuit of biomimetic materials science, including molecular engineering
    for bottom-up assembly of complex nanostructures with diverse chemical, biological,
    photonic, or electronic functions, requires highly interdisciplinary teams. This
    cross-disciplinary work will therefore provide opportunities for very broad-based
    educational experiences to the participants. The cross-pollination provided by
    IRES funded international travel will lead to molecular materials engineering
    advances which could impact many fields of science and technology through applications
    in low-power nanoelectronics, programmable nanochemistry, novel biosensors, and
    smart therapeutics for biomedicine."

    is a great need for the development of fast and simple detection devices for diseases
    ranging from cancer to malaria. Not only will this assist in diagnosing diseases,
    it will also help to monitor treatments and allow for a quick change in treatment
    options if required. A better way to tackle these challenges is to work with an
    interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers. The team will likely develop
    better solutions if they are not only diverse in training, but also diverse in
    culture. For this reason, we will take a diverse group of students, ranging from
    Michigan Tech graduate students, undergraduates from Michigan Tech and other universities,
    and community college students, and have them work for the summer in Denmark.
    \ Aarhus University is a world-class research institution working on health diagnostics
    for the future. The science and engineering students will be joined in this experience
    by a communications student. This student will assist the technical students in
    the creation of videos that describes their experience in the lab and the projects
    they contributed to. This is a shift is how scientific education is often taught.
    This project will break the cycle of engineers and scientists only speaking to
    one another and help open the lines of communication to show the public what is
    happening behind the laboratory doors. The technical students will greatly benefit
    from the exposure to technical communication while the communication student will
    learn more about working with technical researchers. The end product will be 18
    highly trained students who will have increased opportunity to explore technical
    careers while producing videos that explain to the public the importance of the
    research they conducted. The technical students will also create and present posters
    at a local technical conference that highlight the research conducted. \n\nToday?s
    global health challenges require interdisciplinary knowledge, international research
    collaboration, and intercultural communication competencies.  This project will
    provide international research experiences for an interdisciplinary cohort of
    students focused on early detection of malaria and cancer though an established
    collaboration with Michigan Tech and Aarhus University in Denmark.  The goal is
    to create scientists and engineers who can creatively and collaboratively solve
    future problems in health diagnostics and beyond, and we strive to increase the
    students? perspective through this international experience.  Our team consists
    of a biologist, pathologist, mechanical engineer and chemical engineers.  This
    project will explore new disease biomarkers, determine the clinical relevance
    of the biomarkers and design new microdevices that will improve clinical adoption
    of the new technology.  Over a three-year period, the proposed summer international
    research experiences will prepare, annually, a cohort of five diverse science
    and engineering students to engage in an eight-week global biosensor research
    experience and one technical communications student to document and disseminate
    the research efforts.  A unique aspect of this project is the inclusion of a technical
    communications student.  This will provide student researchers with an education
    in scientific communication, which is often lacking in current scientific education,
    but is extremely important for the future of scientific funding and public rapport
    in the U.S.  The incorporation of a technical communications student will synergistically
    teach the scientific students the difficulties and importance of scientific communication
    to the public.  It is expected that all the participants will return as more engaged
    students with an increased propensity for new ideas and collaboration.  In addition,
    the students will engage other students through poster sessions of their experience
    and professionally produced online videos that will provide the motivation for
    others to seek out international research opportunities."

    Applied optics plays a critical role in experimental science and engineering research in fields as diverse as atomic physics and fluid dynamics.  Training the next generation of scientists and engineers in cutting-edge optical techniques is a national challenge that must be met with hands-on student participation in contemporary research.  Dr. Michael Lim of Rowan University will take 15 undergraduate students, between 2017-2019, to perform 10-week-long summer projects hosted by physics groups at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.  NTU is a top-tier international university known for its outstanding science and engineering research.  Students will have unparalleled access to state-of-the-art laser/optical instrumentation and mentorship by Dr. Rainer Dumke and Dr. Claus-Dieter Ohl, well known international experts in their respective fields of atom optics and fluid flows.  The program is designed to immerse students in activities that include designing and constructing optical apparatus, and collecting and analyzing data.  Simultaneously, students will build the communication skills needed for future international collaboration.  Through mini-projects at Edmund Optics, Inc., they will also connect their academic work to industry, allowing them a first-hand look at the interconnectedness of academic research and international business.  A diverse student cohort will be recruited annually from Philadelphia-area institutions that include Rowan University, Rutgers University-Camden, Delaware State University, University of Delaware, Bryn Mawr College, and Temple University.

    Leveraging the strong optics education students at this consortium of schools, the selected cohort will be assigned summer projects in the Quantum Technology (Dumke) and Fluid Dynamics (Ohl) research groups, focusing on laboratory measurements in either ultra-cold atomic physics or modern fluid dynamics.  They will run projects that use optical manipulation or measurement to study laser-frequency stabilization, laser-cooled atoms near superconductors, pattern formation in microfluidic channels, and laser-produced shockwaves in liquids.   This research may result in the co-authorship of refereed journal articles, and all students will be expected to give presentations at scientific professional meetings in the U.S.  The scientific knowledge, technical skills, and experience in global collaboration that participants acquire will provide a competitive edge as students embark on their future career paths.

    Non-Technical Abstract: As future bioengineers, the participating students will appreciate the impact of international differences in regulation, culture and ethics, and engineering approaches. The purpose of the program is to teach, train, and mentor under-represented undergraduates (minorities and women-U.S. citizens or permanent residents) each year via cross-cultural immersion at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)in Singapore. The project themes entail research related to transformative biomedical applications. This IRES project will enhance 1) student learning abilities; 2) intercultural competencies; and 3) retention and enrollment in graduate studies. The program will provide international educational opportunities to enable participants to effectively compete as global leaders in this field.

    Technical Abstract: Efforts to engage U.S. students in biomedical research abroad, particularly those from under-represented groups are essential for training the next generation of STEM professionals who can work in a global environment. In this three year program, under-represented students will be participating in a biomedical-focused international research experience (IRES) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. The participants, all from the EPSCoR state of South Carolina, include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Program objectives will be assessed by measuring how well the IRES program trains participants in 1) research skills (e.g. learning to conduct research, data analysis, formulating research hypotheses); 2) intercultural competencies; and 3) retention and enrollment in graduate studies.
    The IRES research project is in biomedical sciences with specific importance in developing new technologies. During this three year project (2015-17), qualified undergraduates from different institutions will spend eight summer weeks at NTU in Singapore performing research with dedicated mentors.The intellectual merit of the program involves: 1) Creating specific biomedical science projects; 2) Creating well-developed research and outreach activities; and 3) Developing a specific and appropriate plan to measure the PI's goals to train all GMG fellows in the skills of STEM research and learning while living abroad. Broader impacts involve: 1) Providing summer research experiences for under-represented undergraduates designed to encourage pursuit of graduate study; 2) Providing US students from an EPSCoR state the opportunity to conduct research in a Southeast Asian research laboratory and learn intercultural competencies; 3) Leveraging the previous experience and skills of students trained in other programs; 4) Providing designed professional and cultural development activities for the students; 5) Training participants to disseminate their research to biomedical science peers; and 6) Enhancing existing collaborations between Clemson and NTU.

    of Central Florida and the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology (FIDMT)
    in Ilmenau, Germany is focused on adaptive conversational avatars, the rapidly
    emerging field crossing computer engineering, computer science, education, communications,
    and social science.  Immediate applications of this research field include artificial
    intellegence and national security (including cyber-security), interactive robotics,
    improvement of quality of life for disbaled, and health and caretaking for children
    and elderly.\nThis project will place students from the University of Central
    Florida under the mentorship of the PI (Dr. A. J. Gonzalez) and of Dr. Klaus Jantke,
    the counterpart at FIDMT in Ilmenau, Germany. Dr. Jantke is the director of the
    Children's Media Department of FIDMT located in Erfurt, Germany and has a long
    and illustrious history in research in computing media. The international aspect
    of innovative and advanced research is essential in modern research hence the
    PIs will work with three cohorts of students, one during each year of the project's
    existence. Each cohort will include one graduate student and either two undergraduates
    (the first year) or four (in each of the subsequent years).  The research period
    for each cohort will be 16 weeks - eight weeks in the US and eight weeks in Germany
    for each year of the grant period.\nThis research project is motivated by an ancient
    art of storytelling. In our pursuit of an artificially intelligent computer agent,
    the IRES project seeks to build a capability to autonomously synthesize possible
    scenarios for the system development and to modify them dynamically upon listener
    request. More specifically, the topic of the research in this project is the creation
    of an avatar-based system that can synthesize and adapt a scenario according to
    the user's request in real time and without any pre-scripted pathways. Good storytellers
    were treasured in medieval times, given the lack of other media through which
    to relate a story to a mostly illiterate population. Therefore, the project seeks
    to embody the storyteller in a lifelike avatar that resembles an actual person.
    This avatar will tell the story to the listener in spoken natural language, and
    interact with her/him when the latter requests changes to the story. \n\nPart
    2\nStorytelling media have evolved over time, from oral stories to modern E-books.
    Since the development of the computer, storytelling systems have become a science
    of their own, and have evolved from simple systems that can only generate a single
    short story to systems that respond to the listener's actions by modifying the
    story dynamically in real time. Digital storytelling has therefore become a growing
    field within artificial intelligence. The project seeks to take this evolution
    of storytelling media one step further by doing research to create a virtual storyteller
    who tells a dynamic story. The story is modifiable through a request by the listener
    (typically a child, a student, or an elderly person), yet will seek to remain
    realistic as well as interesting. Every story has a story space. That is, only
    so many things can happen in a story. We use contextual reasoning to represent
    the story space. In the real world, courses of action are influenced by the current
    context, making some conversational avatars very attractive while others unattractive
    when addressing the current situation within the story space. In a similar manner,
    the situation faced by the protagonist in the dynamic scenario will limit the
    choices of actions that he/she would otherwise have, thereby taking the story
    in various directions, none of which need be specifically pre-scripted.  The PIs
    base the proposed research on the use of formal methods to manipulate the story
    space within the main theme of the story. By formal methods the PIs mean that
    one represents the story knowledge formally in terms of strings, interaction sequences
    such as storyboards and graphs, formulas (for conditions), and the like. Formal
    methods, therefore, will give the ability to reason with formal methods (string
    comparison, unification, anti-unification and the like) in the story space. Formal
    methods have been used in the literature to manipulate contextual information."

    for Students (IRES): Coupled Geomechanical Processes and Energy Technologies -
    Research Experience at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech -  ENPC, France (?CGPET - ENPC?)
    aims to expose Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) undergraduate and graduate
    students to geomechanical research applied to energy technologies, immerse them
    in the academic culture of a leading European institution (ENPC), and inspire
    them in the pursuit of a scientific career to improve the sustainability and security
    of energy sources and production. Undergraduate and graduate students from Georgia
    Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering (GT-CEE) will complete a two-month
    internship at ENPC Navier Laboratory, to work on research planned and supervised
    by dual ENPC and GT-CEE faculty mentors. Navier Laboratory gathers world?s experts
    in theoretical poro-mechanics and thermodynamics, and has unique experimental,
    imaging and computational facilities especially adapted for geomechanics. Topics
    of study envisioned in this IRES involve fundamental research in the physics of
    thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical coupled processes in geomaterials, multi-scale modeling
    of porous networks, three-dimensional image analysis and advanced numerical simulation
    techniques. The ?CGPET-  ENPC? program will start with five teams of dual mentors,
    who will work on the following subjects: (1) Clay nano-poromechanics for carbon
    dioxide sequestration, (2) Characterization of particulate pore structures for
    geological storage, (3) Micro-mechanical modeling of fatigue in salt rock for
    Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), (4) Reactive fluid injection and withdrawal
    in rock, for oil and gas recovery and geothermal energy systems, and (5) Freeze/thaw
    cycles and sulfate attacks for improved cement-based buffers. Every year, a GT-CEE
    mentor will spend the last week of IRES participants? internship at ENPC, to work
    with his/her ENPC collaborator and supervise GT-CEE students? final research presentations;
    similarly the ENPC mentor will spend the week following the internship period
    at Georgia Tech. \n\nBroader description. \nFundamental understanding of soil,
    rock and cement-based materials is needed to address society?s most pressing needs
    in energy production (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, geothermal systems), energy
    storage (e.g., CAES) and waste management (e.g., nuclear waste disposals, carbon
    capture). Through their engagement in a project aimed to improve energy geotechnologies,
    IRES participants will discover the responsibility of researchers towards their
    sponsors, their scientific community and society at large. Students selected for
    this CGPET ? ENPC program will have an international experience as part of a cohort
    through cultural and professional activities, and will contribute to build and
    maintain a global network of scholars through public research presentations at
    ENPC and GT, wikipage postings, academic publications, and mentoring of new IRES
    participants. Currently, most students enrolled in Civil and Environmental Engineering
    discover soil mechanics during their senior year, through the course of Introduction
    to Geotechnical Engineering. Activities planned before, during and after the ENPC
    internships will expose a broad population of GT students to geomechanical research,
    which will provide opportunities to inspire and attract more students in the pursuit
    of a scientific career. The integration of activities for faculty and undergraduate
    and graduate students from ENPC and GT-CEE is expected to sustain long-term collaborations
    between groups focusing on experimental, theoretical and numerical research in
    energy geomechanics. This IRES will also serve a broader effort to share knowledge,
    expertise and resources between Europe and the United States, and to explore new
    ways to initiate scientific collaborations between high-ranked education and research
    institutions around the world."
