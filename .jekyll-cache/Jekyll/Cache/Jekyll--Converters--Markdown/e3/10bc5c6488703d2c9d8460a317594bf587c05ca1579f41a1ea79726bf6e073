<p><strong>Processing time:</strong> Up to five business days</p>

<p>A DUNS number is a unique, nine-digit number that identifies each physical location of your company. Youâ€™ll need one in order to receive government funding. Because youâ€™re applying for a DUNS number for government funding, processing time should take about five business days.</p>

<p><strong>Processing time:</strong> Up to three weeks</p>

<p>You MUST register to do business with the U.S. government through System for Award Management (SAM). When you register, youâ€™ll have to share bank account information of the account where the NSF funds would be deposited. This registration process is free and takes only 10-15 minutes to initiate, but can take up to three weeks to complete. An active SAM.gov registration is needed to create a FastLane account and submit a proposal to NSF. Registration expires after one year.

(SBIR and STTR proposals are not accepted in Research.gov). We recommend you explore FastLane before submitting your application.</p>
