    <p>Create-a-thons bring people together to develop tangible digital content that organizations can use to amplify their existing census outreach efforts.
<br /><br />
At these engaging workshops, creative students and professionals collaborate with nonprofit and civic organizations to reach hard-to-count communities in their area. In an action-packed session that can run from 2 hours to a full day, participants learn about the importance of getting out the count, connect with other organizations working to reach hard-to-count communities, and generate a bank of content to support 2020 Census outreach efforts.</p>

          <p>The more community leaders and creatives collaborate to create and share, the more opportunities to reach new communities are made. Event participants may choose to create a new create-a-thon of their own or continue working in tandem through the remainder of 2020.</p>
