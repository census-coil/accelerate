    <p>Historically, certain groups have been undercounted at disproportionately high rates, including millennials, rural communities, families with young children, immigrants, non-native English speakers, renters, undererepresented minorities, and people experiencing homelessness ‚Äî these are called ‚Äúhard-to-count‚Äù communities. If these groups aren‚Äôt counted, their communities may not receive their fair share of countless services, resources, and representation.

<div class="usa-width-three-fourths">
    <p>The Decennial Census is a Constitutionally-mandated count of every person living in the United States, once each decade. This population count is used to determine the number of seats each state gets in the U.S. House of Representatives and how to distribute over $675 billion of annual federal funds to states, cities, and local communities for critical infrastructure and services such as housing, highways, schools, hospitals, and more.</p>
    <h4 id="new-opportunities-new-challenges">New Opportunities New Challenges</h4>
    <p>Our next Decennial Census begins on April 1, 2020. This Census will count an increasingly diverse and growing population of about 330 million people in more than 140 million housing units, presenting new challenges.
<br /><br />
This Census is the first ever ‚Äúdigital‚Äù census, which means there‚Äôs now an option to fill out each household census online. This is empowering in some ways but there are some real and perceived risks around participation and data security.
<br /><br />
The media landscape has changed radically in the last 10 years. With the rise of social news and media fragmentation, there‚Äôs a need for more accurate, engaging content on media channels that people use the most in 2020.</p>

Both on and off campus, I apply my design skills to a plethora of projects from a medication-tracking mobile application under Code the Change to a group microlending system that empowers Kenyan women to build financial independence.
