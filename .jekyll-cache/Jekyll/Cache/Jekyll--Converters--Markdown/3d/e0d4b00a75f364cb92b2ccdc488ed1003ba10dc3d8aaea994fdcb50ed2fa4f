    <p>Weâ€™ve partnered with <a href="https://www.rockthevote.org/">Rock the Vote</a> to raise awareness of the 2020 Census for young people through pop culture, music, art and technology.</p>

    <p>We supported Rock the Vote in creating an explainer video (right) on why the census matters; census curriculum as part of their <a href="https://www.rockthevote.org/resources/democracy-class/">Democracy Class</a>; and an open source repository for partner-driven and user-generated content that any census advocate can use for digital organizing (coming soon).</p>

    <p>AnnLab and Wise Entertainment have assembled a powerful coalition of experts in media, communications, data, technology and journalism to directly address perceived risks of census participation among communities fearful and distrusting of being counted.</p>

    <p>Weâ€™ve collaborated with Count the Nation to tap into the brilliant minds and networks of entertainment, executives, creatives and media powerhouses to spread the census message throughout pop culture.</p>
