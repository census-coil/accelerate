          <p>I'm <strong>Victoria</strong>, a Content Advisor for COIL. Born in Los Angeles, I've lived and worked in dozens of countries and am now happily settled back in Ventura, California. I've made a career of using storytelling and digital media strategy to make socially important messages go viral and have led the growth of media companies at Upworthy, Slate, Huffington Post and elsewhere. Now I do the same through my own agency, Finally, for for nonprofits, fortune 500 companies and of course, the Census! I've my career traveling while working, which included sailing around the East Coast and the Caribbean, and living in Puerto Rico during and after hurricane Maria. So, AMA about remote work, where to go for your next vacation and what to pack in a disaster go-bag. Lastly, I believe everything doing is also worth bringing your whole self to. That means that for me, no workday is complete without having a bit of fun and a good laugh and how seriously we're all taking ourselves. My colleague and life partner is an ornery Chihuahua-mix named Honey Dog who never pulls her weight in our shared home office.  </p>
