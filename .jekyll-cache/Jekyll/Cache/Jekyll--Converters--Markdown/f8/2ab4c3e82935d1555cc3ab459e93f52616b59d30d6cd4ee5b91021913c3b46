    <h3 id="what-we-look-for">What we look for</h3>

<p>Hereâ€™s what we look for when determining which companies to fund:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Game-changing:</strong> Your innovation could make a difference to people worldwide or revolutionize an industry.</li>
  <li><strong>High-risk:</strong> Your product is based on unproven technology that needs further testing (and funding for that testing).</li>
  <li><strong>Market pull:</strong> You have evidence that your product or service could meet an important, unmet need for your customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Scale:</strong> If you successfully bring your product or service to market, it could form the foundation for a scalable business and make a large impact in your target market.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h3>

<p>Check out our <a href="/site/portfolio/">portfolio</a> to see what companies weâ€™ve recently funded.</p>

<h3 id="technology-topic-areas">Technology topic areas</h3>

<p>Review this list of technology topic areas (sectors we fund) to see which best aligns with your companyâ€™s work. If none of the technology topic areas quite reflects your work, but you feel your company is otherwise a good fit, you can apply under the Other Topics (OT) category.</p>

<p><strong>Processing time:</strong> Up to five business days</p>

<p>A DUNS number is a unique, nine-digit number that identifies each physical location of your company. Youâ€™ll need one in order to receive government funding. Because youâ€™re applying for a DUNS number for government funding, processing time should take about five business days.</p>

<h3 id="system-for-award-management-sam"><a href="https://www.sam.gov/SAM/">System for Award Management (SAM)</a></h3>
<p><strong>Processing time:</strong> Up to three weeks</p>

<p>You MUST register to do business with the U.S. government through System for Award Management (SAM). When you register, youâ€™ll have to share bank account information of the account where the NSF funds would be deposited. This registration process is free and takes only 10-15 minutes to initiate, but can take up to three weeks to complete. An active SAM.gov registration is needed to create a FastLane account and submit a proposal to NSF. Registration expires after one year. Read the <a href="https://www.sam.gov/sam/transcript/Quick_Guide_for_Grants_Registrations.pdf">SAM Quick Start Guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="researchgov-online-grant-management-for-the-nsf-community"><a href="https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=research_home_page">Research.gov (Online Grant Management for the NSF Community)</a></h3>
<p><strong>Processing time:</strong> Up to 48 hours</p>

<p>Before applying, you need to register your company with NSF in Research.gov. Only after registering with Research.gov can you login to <a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/">FastLane</a> and begin preparing your proposal. (SBIR and STTR proposals are not accepted in Research.gov). We recommend you explore FastLane before submitting your application.</p>

<h3 id="sbir-company-registry"><a href="http://sbir.gov/registration">SBIR Company Registry</a></h3>
<p>Finally, you need to register with the SBIR Company Registry (operated by the Small Business Administration). Post-registration, youâ€™ll receive a Business Concern Control ID (SBC ID), which youâ€™ll need to include in your FastLane application.</p>
