<p>Hereâ€™s what we look for when determining which companies to fund:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Game-changing:</strong> Your innovation could make a difference to people worldwide or revolutionize an industry.</li>
  <li><strong>High-risk:</strong> Your product is based on unproven technology that needs further testing (and funding for that testing).</li>
  <li><strong>Market pull:</strong> You have evidence that your product or service could meet an important, unmet need for your customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Scale:</strong> If you successfully bring your product or service to market, it could form the foundation for a scalable business and make a large impact in your target market.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technology-topic-areas">Technology topic areas</h3>

<p>Review this list of technology topic areas (sectors we fund) to see which best aligns with your companyâ€™s work. If none of the technology topic areas quite reflects your work, but you feel your company is otherwise a good fit, you can apply under the Other Topics (OT) category.</p>
