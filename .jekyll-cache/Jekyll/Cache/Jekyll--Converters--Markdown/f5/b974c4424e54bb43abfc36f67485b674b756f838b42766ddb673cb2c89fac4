      <h1 id="what-is-rd">What is R&amp;D?</h1>

      <p>Americaâ€™s Seed Fund powered by the NSF requires that small businesses use the funding they receive in Phase I and Phase II for R&amp;D. 
The goal of the small businessâ€™s project should be to determine the scientific and technical feasibility of a new concept or innovation that could be developed into new products, processes, or services. Research and development supported by the NSFâ€™s program can be:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A systematic, intensive study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the subject studied;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A systematic study directed specifically toward applying new knowledge to meet a recognized need; or</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A systematic application of knowledge toward the production of useful materials, devices, and systems or methods, including design, development, and improvement of prototypes and new processes to meet specific requirements.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
