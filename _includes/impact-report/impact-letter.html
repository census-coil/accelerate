        <p>Dear reader,</p>

        <p>Starting up the first innovation lab in a 120+-year-old federal agency has required a delicate balance of experimentation with a steadfast commitment to better serving the American people. It can be messy, uncomfortable even, to disrupt tried-and-true systems and ways of working, especially in large institutions where such norms are put in place to protect the public.</p>

        <p>But in our radically changing world, if we don’t keep up with the pace of change, then there is a cost to not trying new things. Think about how much society has changed in the decade since our last Decennial Census in 2010: we shifted from Blockbuster to Netflix, taxicabs to Uber and Lyft, hotels to Airbnbs. And even in 2020, when the Census Bureau had one plan and the world had another, agility became our institution’s greatest asset. </p>

        <p>In an effort as monumental as the 2020 Census -- our nation’s largest peacetime mobilization -- our prerogative is to find new ways to more deeply collaborate with industries, organizations, and communities who have led many of the changes we’ve seen, and learn how to reach the hardest-to-count community members in the digital age.</p>

        <p>That’s exactly what we’ve done with Census Accelerate, a program of the Census Open Innovation Labs that was established to foster new collaborations in order to ensure a more complete and accurate count of our nation. In the last few years, we’ve:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>  ✓	Hosted over 100 workshops with 700+ attendees </li>
          <li>  ✓	Helped generate over 1000 pieces of online shareable content </li>
          <li>  ✓	Worked with 40+ partners </li>
          <li>  ✓	Gained 200+ creative ambassadors </li>
          <li>  ✓	Reached every traditionally hard-to-count community </li>
          <li>  ✓	Helped generate over 750 videos promoting the Census through the Census Bureau’s first-ever video prize competition </li>
        </ul>


        <p>We wrote this report to demonstrate the impact of our activities, and to serve as a blueprint for others who are seeking new modes of civic engagement that are adaptive to the times in which we live. </p>

        <p>To our many partners, we thank you for joining the movement and making this work possible.</p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>

        <p>The Census Accelerate Team</p>
