      <h1 class="the-challenge">The Process</h1>
      <p class="the-challenge-subheader">Census Accelerate sought out to test a new design-thinking model, to activate communities in a non-traditional way, to bring passionate folks from all walks of life together that care deeply about increasing awareness for the 2020 Census- and to work alongside the government in these outreach efforts. We used human-centered design principles as the base for the development of all of our programs and workshops.  By refocusing our goal of getting everyone in America counted and centering our efforts on hard to count communities,  we were able to develop powerful content generating program models that yielded meaningful community lead content and messaging.</p>

        <h3>Census Solutions Workshops</h3>
        <p>Our Partners wanted more out of their engagements with the Census Bureau, so we designed the Census Solutions Workshop. The Census Solutions Workshop  uses  Ideation (or "idea generation")  methodology with partners and participants to generate new community outreach ideas customized to the needs of the hard to count communities they are each serving.</p>
        <p>In 2017 The Census Accelerate team began using the Census Solutions Workshop with partners at conferences around the country. The goal was to bring  diverse communities  together to generate new ideas for campaigns, media, and activities to help Get Out the Count for the 2020 Census.  We designed, tested, and iterated a series of standalone pilot events focusing particularly on traditional hard-to-count (HTC) communities.
        </p>
        <p>At each workshop, creative and innovative ideas started to emerge. Here is a snapshot of some of the outcomes:</p>
        <p> ✓	A neighbor-to-neighbor toolkit for spreading awareness of the census.</p>
        <p> ✓	A toolkit and campaign to engage local libraries in the census count, focusing on people experiencing homelessness.</p>
        <p> ✓	A teen Census Ambassador Program.</p>
        <p> ✓	A census “Get Out the Count” campaign block party for local activation.</p>
        <p> ✓	We’ve hosted 30 Census Solutions Workshops to date.</p>
        <p> ✓	Co-hosted close to 30 Census Solutions Workshops.</p>

        <h3>Create-a-thon Model</h3>
        <p>Many organizations leading 2020 Census outreach efforts have limited creative and/or digital capacity. Yet, as trusted voices, it is vital that their outreach efforts be amplified online to reach as many of their community members as possible. Create-a-thon events bring together creative talent (designers, copywriters, content strategists, video-makers, etc.) with those organizations so that they can conduct more effective digital outreach, with the ultimate goal of increasing self-response rates among the hardest-to-count communities they serve. We called the broader effort to organize Create-a-thons across the country “Creatives for the Count.” The COIL team has hosted 22 Creative-a-thon events across the country. </p>
        <h3>Creative Ambassadors Program</h3>
        <p>We launched the Creative Ambassador program in efforts to encourage artists and storytellers to respond to calls for census content  design support from our community partners. We engaged just over 25 professionals in our Creative Ambassadors Program.  ( Do we have these numbers?)  A highly engaged team of creative ambassadors  develop a DIY Content Toolkit, for and by creatives, guiding them to make content to share within their networks.</p>

        <h3>Who’s Been Involved?</h3>
        <p>Partnerships are key to the success of Census Accelerate efforts. Our Creatives for the Count model has been used far and wide by key organizations reaching hard to count communities in the US. We’ve partnered with advocacy groups, grassroots organizations, non profits, businesses, Complete Count Committees and many more...</p>
        <p>Complete Count Committees (CCC) have been invaluable in expanding these methodologies for creative collaboration with hard-to-count communities, and are key vehicles to nurturing mutual efforts and bringing together state, local and tribal governments; the third sector, private sector and communities.</p>
        <h3>Big Tech Partnerships</h3>
        <p>The massive boom of the technology sector in the last decade has created accompanying concerns around misinformation, disinformation, and cybersecurity. Since 2017, the Census Accelerate team has utilized human-centered design principles to engage industry and ‘Big Tech,’ as a way to activate technology and media industry and leverage their platforms to educate about the importance of the 2020 Census and to inform the public with accurate and factual information. From 2017-2018, Census Accelerate launched a series of roadshows engaging the tech sector, including  companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Google.</p>
