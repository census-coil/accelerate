      <h1 class="the-challenge">Our Impact</h1>
      <p class="the-challenge-subheader">Census Accelerate sought out to test a new design-thinking model, to activate communities in a non-traditional way, to bring passionate folks from all walks of life together that care deeply about increasing awareness for the 2020 Census- and to work alongside the government in these outreach efforts. We used human-centered design principles as the base for the development of all of our programs and workshops.  By refocusing our goal of getting everyone in America counted and centering our efforts on hard to count communities,  we were able to develop powerful content generating program models that yielded meaningful community lead content and messaging. </p>

      <h3>CREATIVESFORTHECOUNT.ORG</h3>
      <p>Our content needed to be centralized and accessible to trusted voices in communities around the nation. In 2019, Census Accelerate created a partnership with Rock the Vote and U.Group, who built creativesforthecount.org. This new platform allowed any partner or community member the chance to upload their own content or download others’ content. Users can filter the content by location, keywords, event type, and hard-to-count population. Creative content ranging from gifs to memes to posters and more are all free and accessible for census advocates to utilize as they educate their communities about the 2020 Census.</p>

      <h3>Get Out the Count Video Prize Challenge</h3>

      <p><b>In March 2020, we put out a call to video content creators across the country…and they answered.</b></p>

      <p>Census Accelerate launched the first-ever U.S. Census Bureau video prize challenge to reward the most engaging, impactful and informative original videos about the 2020 Census - with a total of $50,000 in cash prizes. The competition challenged contestants to make the 2020 Census a must-do for communities, particularly those considered “hard-to-count,” such as racial and ethnic minorities, young and mobile populations, families with young children, LGBTQ+, non-English speakers, among others.</p>

      <p>After receiving over 750 video submissions in over a dozen languages from all across the United States, our panel of judges narrowed it down to three videos with cash prizes totaling $50,000. We recruited over 100 judges from across the U.S. Census Bureau, media companies and organizations representing hard to count communities across the nation. Our challenge allowed many judges the opportunity to reconnect with the heart and community of census work. We received very positive responses from our judges:</p>

      <p>The Get Out The Count Video Prize Challenge concluded with a Livestream Awards Ceremony (viewed over 5,000 times) to announce the winners and highlight some of the engaging census videos created for and by communities across the country.  More than 2,000+ viewers tuned-into the livestream, which featured 14 finalists’ videos and three highlight reels showcasing the best videos in the categories of: Musicals & Songs and COIL’s Top Picks. Viewers shared:</p>

      <p>The top 20 videos have been viewed over 15,000 times and the contest generated over 100,000 visits to the challenge.gov website (total of 103,182 since March 23.</p>

      <h3>Civic Alliance</h3>

      <p>Census Accelerate diversified its impact strategy by collaborating with the private sector. We worked with Civic Alliance -- a nonpartisan group of businesses working together on wide scale civic participation in order to focus on what companies can do to get out the count.</p>

      <p>In March 2020, Census Accelerate teamed up with Civic Alliance to run a 2020 Census sprint -- a process to accelerate actionable outcomes -- in order to engage multiple national consumer brands and tech platforms that could reach large numbers of citizens and encourage them to participate in the 2020 census. Over the course of the sprint, each company developed a product, campaign, or feature, intended to reach their customers and/or employees. Experts within and outside the U.S. Census Bureau were made available to advise member companies throughout the sprint. Participating companies were invited to publicly share their sprint plans and ideas. As a result of changes necessitated by the COVID pandemic, the scheduled event was cancelled. However, to date, we catalyzed collaborations with the following companies:</p>

      <h3>Digital Action Weekend</h3>
      <p>In May 2020, Census Accelerate joined forces with CPEP and NPP on a national day of digital action to activate influencers, celebrities and partners at once. This was in an effort to create a unified and concentrated drumbeat in pushing creative census content out online. The weekend focused on two distinct but related efforts: 1) celebrity/influencer activation & 2) Tweet-a-thon (Census Accelerate) that was rolled up into a single weekend event from May 1-3. </p>
      <p>We worked with Twitter and Census Counts for a day of digital action to deploy over 500 pieces of content from creativesforthecount.org and partner content. In addition, CPEP/NPP activated influencers and celebrities by leveraging the support from governors, trusted voices, SCCCs, CCCs and other partners to achieve a groundswell of content distribution and make #2020Census trend on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Due to the enormous success of Digital Action Weekend, there was a spike for #creativeforthecount and the Get Out the Count Video Challenge distribution, generating thousands of visits to the challenge.gov website (total of 103,182 since March 23) that inevitably drove up our submissions rate. Promotion of census content was seen across  Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Over four hundred new posts were generated on Facebook alone, with the most engaging post and most viewed video from the School District of Palm Beach County, generating over 4,600 views.</p>
      <p>	In addition, as a result of this massive push, over one thousand new users visited our accelerate.census.gov website and over two thousands new users utilized the content on the creativesforthecount.org website.</p>

      <h3>Combating Misinformation with Big Tech</h3>

      <p>Census Accelerate partnered with Big tech companies  about the importance of communicating to the public accurate information about the 2020 Census and protecting it from interference. Census Accelerate and partners led a concerted effort to address misinformation shared on social media platforms. </p>

      <p>In the spring and fall of 2019, Census Accelerate launched a series of convenings that brought together technology experts and civic leaders invested in successful digital strategies for the 2020 Census. At the Civic Digital Strategy Workshop at Facebook’s Washington,  DC offices, we convenedalong with Twitter, Google, and other civil society groups, These convenings focused on technology, civil society, and social platforms' roles in informing the public about the importance of being counted.</p>

      <p>The Civic Digital Strategy series consisted of three training and workshops that brought together Twitter, Google and Facebook alongside other civil society groups. These events focused on technology, civil society, and social platforms' roles in informing the public about the importance of being counted and ensuring a coordinated response across all partners and stakeholders.</p>

      <p><b>It also resulted in a commitment to combat fraudulent activities to help protect the integrity of the 2020 Census — which included preventing the spread of fake, false, and inaccurate information that can negatively influence the 2020 Census.</b></p>

      <p>Additionally, Google developed a Google Ads Playbook for civil society groups which helped them coordinate outreach and communication efforts. Since then, the U.S. Census Bureau has established the government’s first-ever Trust & Safety Team to help protect the population's count.</p>

      <p>Census Accelerate has partnered with Code for America, a technology non profit, and their Brigade Network to coordinate on supporting their local communities on the 2020 Census. The Brigade Network is a large network of community organizations, developers and designers within the Code for America network that seeks to put technology forward in service of local communities, a Brigade Network. These convenings included a:</p>

	    <p>✓	Brigades for the Count webinar for local census committees Complete Count Committees to connect with local Code for America Brigades, so that local volunteer technologists could team up with local advocates to support 2020 Census efforts.</p>

      <p>✓	A second convening with Code for America, New America, and U.S. Census Bureau staff  about potential brigade activations, including supporting Complete Count Committees with digital tools and flagging content that may communicate inaccurate or false information about the 2020 Census at a local level. </p>

      <h3>Powered by the Community</h3>

      <p>In February 2018, The Census Accelerate team developed Census Solutions Workshops  and  Create-a-thon toolkits, offering a step- by- step guide for national and community partners to host their own events. The toolkit was distributed through the U.S. Census Bureau partner websites National Partnerships Program (NPP) and Community Partnerships and Engagement (CPEP and downloaded over 1000+ times. Both organizations adopted the workshop model and deployed the Create a thon event and Census solutions workshop in every Census region-  Making these the Accelerate human -centered design thinking program models U.S. Census Bureau engaged and activated partners for the 2020 Census. </p>

      <p>By the end of 2019, Census community partners, Complete Count Committees, and communities started adopting the Census Solutions Workshop model and Create-a-thons all over the nation.  Census Accelerate developed a guide for facilitators in and outside the Census Bureau to run these design thinking workshops in their various regions. To date, hundreds of Create a thon  and Census solutions workshops have been instituted, resulting in thousands of new ideas and partnerships to support a complete and accurate count for the 2020 Census.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <h3>What's Next</h3>

      <p>As the complete and accurate count of the nation becomes more and more imperative in the coming months, cross sector collaborations and the power of civically engaged coalitions will be more critical than ever before. Census Accelerate sought out to test a new design-thinking model, to activate communities in a non-traditional way, to bring passionate folks from all walks of life together that care deeply about increasing awareness for the 2020 Census- and to work alongside the government in these outreach efforts. </p>

      <p>The Census Accelerate Team has demonstrated how consistent, collaborative efforts can impact a feat as great as the U.S. Census. As the self-response period comes to a close, we are seeing the fruits of  our labor being utilized across the nation as our shareables and video creative are helping to promote the 2020 Census to communities everywhere, our design-thinking models are impacting partners within and outside of the Census Bureau, and our big tech partnerships continue to combat misinformation around the Census online.</p>

       <p>The replicable models we created can continue to benefit other programs, initiatives and surveys of the like. They have allowed for communities to take more ownership of the 2020 Census in what has traditionally been a government down approach. By creating an adaptable model to plug in the creative potential of our nation, and integrating the diversity of talents and trusted voices of a community, more content is available online that is relatable, compelling and effective. The census has become personal and  it has become a necessary agenda item for individual and community advocacy.</p>
