      <h1 class="the-challenge">Our Impact</h1>
      <p class="the-challenge-subheader">Census Accelerate sought out to test a new design-thinking model, to activate communities in a non-traditional way, to bring passionate folks from all walks of life together that care deeply about increasing awareness for the 2020 Census- and to work alongside the government in these outreach efforts. We used human-centered design principles as the base for the development of all of our programs and workshops.  By refocusing our goal of getting everyone in America counted and centering our efforts on hard to count communities,  we were able to develop powerful content generating program models that yielded meaningful community lead content and messaging. </p>

        <p>The content that’s been developed has ranged from professional quality graphic designs, to user generated videos, to funny memes, to simple hand-drawn sketches and even a few songs. What has mattered most is that the content delivers information and calls to action in the most authentic ways that speak to people’s culture, worldview, and personality.</p>

          <p>Where:  Virtual</p>
          <p>When: June 20, 2020 </p>
          <p>How: With the theme of non-traditional housing, the event participants from across New York City produced community-driven outreach materials for distribution and use by census partners.  Content was created for reaching out to multi-generational & NYC’s “doubled-up” households, multi-family dwellings, split custody arrangements, individuals forgotten on the census, and highly mobile families across New York City.  The event title NYC@Home was selected to indicate the unique residential situation of many New Yorkers, as well as reference the quarantining taking place due to the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>

      <h3>CREATIVESFORTHECOUNT.ORG</h3>
      <p>Our content needed to be centralized and accessible to trusted voices in communities around the nation. In 2019, Census Accelerate created a partnership with Rock the Vote and U.Group, who built creativesforthecount.org. This new platform allowed any partner or community member the chance to upload their own content or download others’ content. Users can filter the content by location, keywords, event type, and hard-to-count population. Creative content ranging from gifs to memes to posters and more are all free and accessible for census advocates to utilize as they educate their communities about the 2020 Census.</p>

      <h3>Get Out the Count Video Prize Challenge</h3>

      <p><b>In March 2020, we put out a call to video content creators across the country…and they answered.</b></p>

      <p>Census Accelerate launched the first-ever U.S. Census Bureau video prize challenge to reward the most engaging, impactful and informative original videos about the 2020 Census - with a total of $50,000 in cash prizes. The competition challenged contestants to make the 2020 Census a must-do for communities, particularly those considered “hard-to-count,” such as racial and ethnic minorities, young and mobile populations, families with young children, LGBTQ+, non-English speakers, among others.</p>

      <p>After receiving over 750 video submissions in over a dozen languages from all across the United States, our panel of judges narrowed it down to three videos with cash prizes totaling $50,000. We recruited over 100 judges from across the U.S. Census Bureau, media companies and organizations representing hard to count communities across the nation. Our challenge allowed many judges the opportunity to reconnect with the heart and community of census work. We received very positive responses from our judges:</p>

          <p>Each video told a story I wanted and needed to see, hear and experience. The videos spoke of our humanity by highlighting the realities of what the 2020 Census is really all about--it’s about people, not just stats. That's my takeaway. I completed my judging assignment today with part of our nation engraved on my heart. Thank you for that.</p>
